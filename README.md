# Sentiment Analysis and Product Recommendation from Reviews
From the Kindle Store Reviews on Amazon, sentiment analysis and book recommendation

**Problem:**

Day by day, demand in e-commerce is increasing. With the increasing demand in online stores, voice of customer concepts such as reviews and customer experiences are getting more important. Because, customers buy products without seeing or touching them. If the company fails to meet this need of customers, it loses money because of not taking strategic decisions.

**Aim:** 

Protect company from losing money with increasing customer satisfaction and giving importance to their feedback.

**Solution:**

- define good or bad products as quick as possible according to reviews and take action for this
For this solution, I worked on sentiment analysis with deep learning. The model predict reviews as positive or negative from text.

- recommend customers related products to increase satisfaction with decreasing search time for suitable product;
  I build recommendation system in this project for this solution.
  
**Business Value:**

- product comparison
- defining like/dislikes
- saving time
- selling more products = more money
- happier customers = more customers = more money
- less time on server = less problem
