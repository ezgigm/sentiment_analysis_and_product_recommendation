The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.

Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.

For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

5.0,False,"12 6, 2003",A1I2O9Y3X3HXLS,B000FA65EK,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},Arthur W Jordin,"Hades' Daughter is the first novel in the Troy Game series.  Millennia ago, during the late Bronze Age, the king of Athens was forced to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete every nine years.  There they were left in the dark maze of the Labyrinth to become victims of Asterion, the Minotaur son of the Minoan king.  One year, the Athenian king sent Theseus, his own son, to Crete among the sacrificial levy.  Theseus gained the love of the Minoan king's daughter, Ariadne, slayed Asterion and escaped with the other captives, Ariadne, and her younger sister Phaedra.
Now Ariadne was pregnant with a daughter by Theseus and he had become infatuated with Phaedra.  So Theseus abandoned Ariadne and his unborn daughter on the island of Naxos, saying that it would be too dangerous for her to sail on and that he would return from Athens after the child was born to take them to his home.  When Ariadne objected, Theseus claimed that he was only doing the will of the gods and sailed off with his his paramour to Athens.  In her anger, Ariadne plotted vengeance against the entire Aegean world, gods as well as men, and used her powers as Mistress of the Labyrinth to initiate the destruction of all the labyrinths except one.  Since these labyrinths had been used to magically trap all manner of evil influences to protect their cities, corruption and destruction soon began to spread throughout the Aegean.
After launching her curse, Ariadne sailed away from Naxos to the far distant island of Albion.  In the following years, disaster after catastrophe destroyed cities and crops and lives throughout the Aegean as the labyrinths failed.  Finally, the Aegean world was wracked by the ten year Trojan War, spreading Trojan refugees throughout the known world.
In this novel, 98 years after the fall of Troy, the Trojan Kingman Brutus, son of Silvius and heir of Aeneas, is visited by the seeming of the goddess Artemis and told that he is destined to build Troia Nova on the island of Albion.  First, however, he must complete a task to prove his worthiness.
Cornelia is a fifteen year old dreamer who has decided on a certain youth as her future husband.  When this youth is slain by Brutus and then Brutus takes her in marriage by force of arms, Cornelia screams her hatred and starts to plot against the Trojans.  When that plot and other efforts to oppose Brutus fail disastrously, Cornelia blames herself for the lost lives and her spirit is broken.
In this story, the Trojans sail to Llangarlia on Albion as victims of a great scheme by the great-great-granddaughter of Ariadne to reconstruct the Game (or labyrinth) of Troy upon the Veiled Hills above the banks of the River Llan.  She is the only surviving Mistress of the labyrinth and Brutus is the only surviving Kingman.  Together the two can rebuild the Trojan Game and Brutus will sacrifice almost anything to gain that power.  Strangely, however, he can't quite sacrifice Cornelia.
This story is rich in ancient Greek and British allusions and nuances.  The many details of ordinary life in those societies make the tale convincing and immediate.  One finds oneself vicariously living among these characters and participating in their lives.
The story nicely weaves the myth of the Minotaur with other Greek and British myths.  The author tells us why and how the Aegean world self-destructed.  Moreover, she tells you the real story of the city of Llanbank on Albion.  Just when you thought you knew the truth, this novel comes along to confuse you once more.
The story does include some rather explicit sex and sexual cravings.  Moreover, the relationship between Brutus and Cornelia has more than a hint of sado-masochism, but may be fairly typical of those brutish times. This relationship is nicely contrasted with such bonds within the matriarchial Llangarlian society.
This novel does move somewhat slowly at first.  One is almost tempted to look ahead to see how it will come out.  Moreover, the author has interspersed scenes from pre-war London prior to the Blitz to further tantalize the reader.  Just when the story is beginning to really move, however, it terminates;  although it will be continued in God's Concubine, one hates to wait.

2.0,False,"06 9, 2003",A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000FA65EK,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},Diana Faillace Von Behren,"Luckily, I listened to this book while I exercised rather than read it and found that Douglass's straightforward uncomplicated literary style directly complimented the mindless activity I strove to accomplish.  This is not to say that I thought the book uninteresting or boring in any way.  On the contrary, the storyline moves along, albeit the pre-historical plotline jars pathetically with the author's modern jargon leaving the reader no choice but to roll one's eyes upward in utter amazement at the blatant inconsistency.

In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a somewhat undefined 'game' at which a labyrinth plays an integral part in protecting the city in which it is located.  With the anger of a spurned woman, Ariadne of Crete beseiges her half-man half-bull brother Asterion to teach her the dark ways that will help her destroy the power of the labyrinth after Theseus throws her over for her younger sister.  Of course, as mistress of the labyrinth, she leaves a backdoor for herself and her female progeny--a way in which to recreate the game in a future time and reclaim her power.  Approximately 100 years later, Ariadne's heir Genvesa is all but ready, however she needs a King man to help her dance the mystical powers of the game back into being and forever trap Asterion in the center of the maze.  Trojan Brutus, adept at the game, is her man and through a series of ploys and adventures, Genvesa lures him from Greece to the misty land of Albion--the southern portion of the British Isles.  One crucial problem arises to snag Genvesa's plans when Brutus impulsively takes Cornelia, the daughter of a conquered king, as his wife and drags her along on his quest for the promised land of New Troy. In Albion, Genvesa has all but destroyed the old god and goddess that ruled the island.  When the Albion mother goddess, Mag, Genvesa's chief foe, hides within Cornelia, Genvesa's plans to reconstruct the game are almost permanently foiled.

As you can imagine, this tale is long and fraught with the machinations of all characters who seek either self-preservation or the heady power of pure domination.  Douglass cleverly combines many myths to support her premise and to bring alive the baser natures of her creations.  However trite, there is sex, gore and raw emotion galore, so much so that I found myself wincing with disgust at many of the too descriptive passages enlightening the reader to scenes of birth, death and utter savagery.  The characters seem to be intentionally crafted as archetypes like the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece rather than real fleshed out personas. Brutus lives only for the power of kingship and possession of Genvesa.  Cornelia, raped and torn from her family and country, somehow improbably forgets her grief and yearns for love from her brutal husband.  Genvesa connives with a hallowe'en witch's malevolence while the rest of the cast are simply not finely drawn enough to not be categorized as either good or evil.  All characters are either blighted with trite dialogue or overly long-winded emotional explosions.

Bottom line:  While the story will keep your attention, none of the characters are subtle enough to capture your emotions; they are stylized shadows which at times fail to elicit much response other than a shrug and a turn of the page.  The literary style fails to recreate a feel for ancient times, rather it attributes modern day sensibilities to otherwise primordial savages.

It's rare that I completely abandon a book these days. And when I do, it almost always happens on page fifty, once I've had more than enough of whatever piece of the structure I can't take any more. That didn't happen with Hades' Daughter, in part because when I reached page fifty I was locked out of the house and had no other reading material.

Nicholas finally marries Etna and with full knowledge that she will never love him. She had told him. Nonetheless, he insists, believing he can make her love him. In addition, Etna, a woman before her time, hungers for independence. In the early 1900's, this is neither commonly accepted nor accommodated. Nicholas is definitely a man of his time, and does not feel Etna's independence is proper. Wishing to hold onto his wife and to acquire a position for which he longs at the college, Nicholas resorts to an outrageous act.

This book is a reflection of Nicholas's life. Nicholas Van Tassel is actually riding in a train and writing this account of his life for his son. As he looks back on his life, the reader is given a one-sided account, his interpretation, of his career as a college professor and of his marriage to Etna Bliss.

Sweeney,"At the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, 30-year-old, Thrupps College teacher Nicholas Van Tassel is involved in a restaurant fire. Also a victim is Etna Bliss, visiting niece of a fellow professor. Assisting her and her aunt home, the usual staid and controlled Nicholas is so smitten, he courts and asks Etna to marry him. She turns him down. He's distraught. Startled and flattered by his reaction, Etna accepts his proposal for she can't believe a man could love her so. Thus the love affair is one-sided from the beginning.

The marriage goes on an even keel with Nicholas accepting that Etna has less passion for him than he for her. They have two children. She throws herself into volunteer work. Then he discovers she has purchased a cottage and has been going there on days he thought she was doing charity work. Etna's excuse is that she wishes a refuge, a place to escape from her everyday life for a while but Nicholas refuses to believe it.  When a visiting professor from Yale is discovered to be the brother of a man Etna had a love affair with when she was younger, and is also in the running to be named Dean at Thrupps, a position Nicholas covets, his jealousy erupts. Philip Asher and Etna renew their friendship, making Nicholas view the younger man as a competitor for his wife's affection, and the fact that Asher is a Jew makes the insult greater.

Forcing his teenage daughter to be his accomplice, Nicholas formulates a plan to rid himself of his rival, both from his wife's life and the position at the college...

The story, with its overtones of racial prejudice, are told in flashback as Nicholas makes a train journey to Florida, showing too late the extent of his guilt and his love, as well as his repentance for what he has done.

While Nicholas' obsession with Etna isn't the bloodthirsty, murderous kind, it still has enough of a hold that even thirty years later, when the story is told, his passion, so tightly controlled except on this one subject, still breaks through. It is the story of a man not expecting to find such a burning emotion for a woman, allowing it to secretly influence him to such an extent that he'll ruin an innocent man's reputation to get her back.

Nicholas succeeds in his attempt but fails at the same time for his victory is a bitter one. What he does forever clouds his life, as well as Etna's, Asher's, and his two children's.

I think a lot of people think these types of people are not caring or loving, they are but not if it does not suit their purpose. How he manipulated his daughter was disgusting.

Amazon Rating: 4/5 stars

Another excellent Anita Shreve book, ALL HE EVER WANTED is unique in that the main character and narrator is a man. The story takes place in the early 1900's, and begins with a restaurant fire. The narrator had been eating in the hotel restaurant when the fire broke, and he relates to the event and his first glimpse of the woman who will eventually become his wife. What is important is the narration, as it gives the reader a very good observation of the character of this person, Nicholas Van Tassel, who will come across to most as learned, somewhat pompous and at times arrogant. His speech is, I felt, over the top, and this is what gives one the impression that he often times feels he's above everyone else (which is implied, not stated).

He is immediately besotted with this beautiful woman, who is a little past marriageable age but nevertheless attracts his attention. He cannot stop thinking about her. He finds a way to meet her, and learns that she is the niece of a colleague of his at Thrupp College, where he himself is also a professor. Her parents are deceased, so she is currently living with her uncle Professor Bliss until she is ready to return home to what is now has become her brother in law's house  (being a woman, she had no rights to the property where she had lived with her parents. Thus she was kicked out of her own house).

Nicholas begins to woo Etna, coming to see her at her uncle's house and asking to take walks with her. The courtship is slow and long, and Etna (the reader will notice) is not enamored with Nicholas as he is with her. Eventually, Nicholas gets the courage to ask for her hand in marriage, and Etna does accept eventually, as it is the better of two evils - she knows that her fate was to live the life of a spinster, becoming the nanny to her sister's children.

Thus begins the life of Nicholas and Etna Bliss, with Etna agreeing to be the mother of his children, to be his wife. They have two children and to the outside world all seems to be perfect. But the marriage was lacking in one important factor - Etna did not love Nicholas, and Nicholas knows this. He hopes that as the years progress that his wife will learn to love him as much as he passionately loves her.

The reader will know immediately that Nicholas's love for Etna is not a healthy one. He is obsessed with her, as is evidenced by his thoughts throughout the narration, and his actions. Etna is trapped in a marriage she never wanted, but felt she had to accept because she needed stability and a place to call her own. What Nicholas does not know for quite a while is that Etna is keeping secrets. And Etna does her best to keep them hidden, as they are the only sources of happiness she has in this one-sided marriage.

I wasn't sure if I would like ALL HE EVER WANTED, being somewhat skeptical with the male narration, but it worked for me. Shreve creates a character that the reader will loathe, or maybe feel pity for, but I certainly had strong feelings towards this man who I felt was a chauvinist and a pompous jerk. But was he a result of the times? Maybe. Still, the life he and Etna create together is far from perfect, and I could certainly understand Etna's needs.

I found this book so unsatisfying that I vowed to never read another Shreve work.  But an aunt encouraged me to read All He Ever Wanted and I was floored by this beautifully written and hauntingly tragic story.

All He Ever Wanted is written in the first person through the eyes of Nicholas Van Tassel.  Starting in 1899, Van Tassel is a professor of history at Thrupp--a small college in a small New Hampshire town of the same name.  Van Tassel is eating dinner at the Thrupp Hotel when a fire breaks out.  He gives aid to a number of other patrons, and is immediately smitten by the lovely Etna Bliss.  Van Tassel embarks on a crusade to win the hand of Etna. While he's passionately in love with Miss Bliss, she shares a fondness for the professor that falls short of love.

I can't divulge more about the plot without giving it away.  But let me say it is a book that will haunt you with questions and what ifs.  Is it possible to be happy with someone knowing that they don't love you?  It is possible to love someone too much?  How does love and passion turn into a dangerous obsession?  What is the difference between love and ownership?  And how is it that obsessive love can drive intelligent people to do rash, stupid, unethical and even illegal things (consider the recent case of astronaut Lisa Nowak)? You will continue thinking about this book long after you've finished.

Shreve writes beautifully in All He Ever Wanted, though it is in the style of the Victorian era with lots of flourishes and embellishments.  Van Tassel describes his courtship period as ""They were as well days of great turbulence of the heart, of unparalleled joy of the spirit,  and of a thrill within the blood such as I had never known before.""  The prose reminds me of Geraldine Brooks, author of both Year of Wonders and March.  As a physical education teacher, I had to especially chuckle at Van Tassel's efforts to keep physical education out of Thrupp College.  ""To give a degree to students whose chief occupation for four years has been employing wood-and-iron dumbbells in rhythmic motions or running circles in a gymnasium, all the while yelling like Rebels, is nothing short of absurd.""  Unfortunately, such flowery writing will not appeal to all readers.

It starts off simply ~~ there's a hotel fire while Nicholas, the main character, was having his dinner. A professor at the local college, he was just enjoying his meal when a fireball bursts through the restaurant. Once outside, he finds himself enthralled with a young woman who was taking care of a young girl and an older woman. That woman eventually became his wife, Etna. Etna has made it clear from the beginning that she does not love Nicholas and she probably never will.

This is a darker book than I suspected ~~ a book of passion, betrayal and loss. This is a book where a man finds himself in despair and drove his wife away and broke up a very happy little home because he couldn't control his jealousy. It is an uncomfortable book where the reader finds out that one person in this marriage loves the other more than anything in this world, but it's not a beautiful thing to watch since it was a possessive love. (The whole time I was reading this book, I kept thinking, thank goodness that I am not the one married to this guy!)

At the same time while I was being appalled, I was also compelled to keep reading to the bitter end. It is very well-written and interesting enough to the end. Just a very dark and bitter book ~~ something that I wasn't expecting to discover when I picked this book up to read over the holiday vacation.

But as I thought about it, I did in fact enjoy the book and it was the characters I did not like.  As the story progressed, it was obvious that Nicholas was a pompous, arrogant bigot who would essentially stop at nothing to get what he wanted.  While taking into account that the story is told from Nicholas' point of view, if he is to be believed, Etna was a cold, stand-offish woman, who never should have married this man.  While she was a product of her time, and there were woman who had no choice but to marry men they did not love, she, on the other hand seemed to have options.  While the letters between Etna and Phillip shed some light into her personality, I found it difficult to understand why she would reveal so much to him.  Was she perhaps using him to get back into Samuel's life?

The narrator of the story (who is recounting his past while en route to his sister's funeral) bachelor Nicholas Van Tassel, a stuffy professor at a snotty boys' school, is inside the hotel when the blaze begins but leaves unscathed.  During this tragedy where twenty people perish in a fiery death he meets the woman of his dreams, Etna Bliss.
Etna's ""handsome"" face, her lovely waist and her other womanly attributes haunt his every thought.  Even her name, Bliss, brings lusty thoughts to his mind (and starts my skin to crawling).  His infatuation is all consuming and before long he begins to pursue her with all of the gusto of a starving dog drooling over a choice bit of meat.  She eventually agrees to a date where he learns, a bit to his dismay, that she has a brain as well as fine breasts and is surprisingly literate.  They read stories together and seem to get along well but when he makes a move or turns the conversation towards the personal she immediately gives him the cold shoulder.  I should add that Nicholas is described as the most un-athletic man on earth with a slight paunch and a balding pate.  The sexual attraction seems entirely one-sided and a bit creepy.  At this point I would've put the book aside unfinished as I found Nicholas Van Tassel boring beyond belief and far too pompous.  However, since I was listening to this in its unabridged format and I was stuck in traffic I continued to torture myself with Nicholas Van Tassel's words (expertly read by a narrator who reads in a purposely haughty way).
Despite the fact that Etna does not return his feelings of undying love he insists that they marry and, oddly enough, she agrees!  Thus begins their awkward life together.  During their years of marriage they parent two children (and, thakfully, we are spared the oogey details of their sterile love making ~ thank you Mr. Van Tassel for speedily skipping by those bits and saving me a few shudders!) and seem to get along decently enough as they plod along through their days.  Nicholas gives Etna a nice life and the freedom to do whatever she wishes but sadly the love Nicholas aches for is never returned by Etna.  Nicholas, the poor love starved sap, is grateful just to have her for his wife and doesn't complain about her complete lack of affection towards him.  But things begin to change when he discovers that Etna has been hiding things from him.  This is where the book finally picked up and actually engaged my full attention.
At this point Nicholas *almost* becomes a sympathetic character if you can believe it (though he is still a thoroughly unpleasant fellow)!  He is riddled with insecurities and although he has been married to a woman he cherishes for years he will never be a happy or successful man.  His world begins to spiral out of control as he simultaneously discovers Etna's been keeping secrets and learns the position he's been longing to have at the University may be forever out of his reach.
Nicholas's festering jealously and over-reaction to Etna's secret (which was odd but not nearly as devastatingly earth-shattering as I'd anticipated), however, ruin any smidgen of pity I may have felt for him just a few chapters earlier.  Author Shreve successfully paints an unpleasant picture of a thoroughly unpleasant man caught up in a situation of his own making.

Written entirely from the point of view of a stodgy male college professor circa 1900, this is the story of a passion so intense, so unlike the writer himself, that it is scarcely believable, especially when related in the stilted flowery language of the day.
Nicholas Van Tassel, a rather ordinary pedantic with nothing particularly unusual about him, happens to be in a hotel restaurant when it catches fire. This single pivotal episode in his otherwise unremarkable life changes him forever--it is during the rescue effort that he encounters Miss Etna Bliss, and falls head over heels into a passion that borders on, indeed IS, an obsession.
Hampered by the extreme rules of etiquette governing proper men and women of the day, Van Tassel nevertheless pursues Miss Bliss, finally persuading her to marry him despite her the fact that, as she honestly tells him, she does not love him. Love will come, thinks Van Tassel, hardly able to believe his luck in winning his prize. And that hope, that fantasy, that overwhelming obsession of his entire being, eventually destroys the narrator, his wife, and his entire family.
Shreve stays in character completely and thoroughly, managing to evoke the failings of the man himself, the restrictions of the society in which he lives, and the hopelessness of his obsession without ever once betraying herself. It is safe to say that the author stays well in the background while letting Van Tassel tell his own tragic story.

And as she did in he previous historical novels, the author offers her readers a wonderful novel and one that left me wishing for another book by Anita Shreve.
All He Ever Wanted begins during a fire when Nicholas Van Tassel, a professor at a small college in New Hampshire, spots a young woman and accompanies her home that evening.  Almost immediately Nicholas becomes besotted with the woman Ms. Etna Bliss and begins courting her.  From this point of the narrative, Shreve moves the scene to a time many years later as Nicholas recounts the story of his love for Etna on a train as he is bound for his sister's funeral in Florida.  At this point Shreve becomes almost a modern day Edith Wharton as through Nicholas we come to learn about his views of society in the early 1900's through 1930.  As readers, we watch as Nicholas becomes further obsessed with Etna, thwarts a rival for a competitive position at the college and eventually comes under scrutiny for a transgression he did many years before. And as these events are taking place we also watch as Nicholas' and Etna's relationship begins to spiral out of control and wonder how this will all be resolved.  For in the end all Nicholas ever wanted is the love of Etna.
I highly recommend this book to those readers who have enjoyed Anita Shreve in the past and for those who may want to read her for the first time.  The author has a wonderful ability to put her readers right between the pages of the book.  In addition the narrative evokes the language and society of the 1900's.

her latest: ALL HE EVER WANTED . . . one thing I really like about
her is that ever book seems different . . . she just doesn't follow
the formulaic approach used by many writers to come up with
essentially the same story.
This particular tale of unrequited love is set in New Hampshire
in the early 1900s . . . it involves a college professor who meets,
by accident, a woman and then sets out to marry her . . . he
does reach his goal, but does he really? . . . that is the question
that I'm still thinking about, long after I finished the last page.
Shreve really gives you a feel for what living in New England in a
small college town must have been like . . . she also has the
male perspective down pat (it is written from the professor's
standpoint) . . . and I especially liked a section wherein the plot
was moved along by a series of letters between two of the characters.
For example, here's part of one such correspondence:
Your husband has sent round a note just now asking me to your house
for a drink at half past five o'clock tonight. I feel I cannot decline, but
wish I could speak with you on the matter before I go. I look forward
to seeing you should you be there this evening. In the matter to which
we have been referring in our previous correspondence, let me just say
that the sight of your face on that morning so many years ago has
remained for me a standard by which I judge my own affection
for any woman with whom I am close, and the affection of any
woman for me. I count you among the most fortunate of persons
to have felt so strongly for another human being, however
unhappy the outcome. Is this not the point of our existence?
Yet the writing throughout is equally compelling, as evidenced
by these two other parts:
Though Etna asserts that her love was genuine, it is Asher who speaks
of passion. ""The ferocity of love that lies behind the veil of polite
comportment,"" he writes. And this: ""The sight of your face on that
morning so many years ago has remained for me a standard by which
I judge my own affection of any woman with whom I am close, and the
affection of any woman for me. I count you among the most fortunate
of persons to have felt so strongly for another human being, however
unhappy the outcome. Is this not the point of our existence?""
I pondered also the nature of fate and circumstance. Had it not been
for the fire, I doubt I should ever have met Etna Bliss. Did I now wish
that those few drops of oil in the hotel kitchen had not fallen onto
the cooking fire? Might I have eaten my poached sole in solitude and
never noticed the young woman in the topaz silk sitting behind me
and thus escaped both the joy and anguish of the next fifteen years,
only to have met, two months later, say, the daughter of a rare-book
dealer from Thrupp whom I then married? Might I never have encountered
Etna Bliss at all, but rather have seen a woman emerging from a trolley
three days later to whom I gave pursuit and was ultimately betrothed?
Or have been introduced at a faculty party at the college to the wife
of a colleague (no, never; the sentence does not bear completion, for
I should never have stooped so low) . . . or chance upon, in twenty years'
time, after having remained of decades a bachelor, a widow to whom
my academic credentials, not to mention my modest fortune, might
have been attractive? Or, then again, might I actually have met a worse
fate that was dealt to me? Might I have wed the daughter of a physician
who bore me a child who then died as a result of my wife's carelessness?

However, when a fire in a hotel restaurant propels Van Tassel out into the cold, he happens to look up and see a striking woman standing across the street. An instant obsession forms on his part and for him she will become the thing he must have, no matter what it will cost him.
The narration of this story actually takes place sixty-four years after it begins in December 1899. Van Tassel is traveling to his sister's funeral and is afforded much time to ponder the events which have unfolded since he met Etna Bliss, the woman who would be the cause of his greatest joy...and grief.
Circumstances have brought him to a point where he feels it necessary to provide an explanation to his son. This he will do via a journal that chronicles the years shared with Etna and the emotions brought on by them (sprinkled with a bit of hindsight commentary and other present-day notations).
Van Tassel's writing will serve more than just the intended purpose. It will also offer him the opportunity to purge his soul of his lifelong obsession.
Anita Shreve's account of one man's fixation on fully possessing a woman he can never truly know, understand or be loved by is fraught with passion, perfidy and pain.
It is told in the first person, so even the reader is never privy to what happens in the mind of Etna Bliss. This can become frustrating at times when introduced to a mysterious incident in Etna's past, which so wholly affects her present and future life with Van Tassel. The reader experiences a need to know which remains unfulfilled except for the explanation formed only in the imagination of Van Tassel based on his own similar, yet more desperate, need to know.
An overconfident reader will not enjoy the book based on a preconceived idea that the outcome is obvious. One should refrain from making assumptions based on what seems like blatant foreshadowing and simply absorb the story as it is being written by Professor Van Tassel. Some of the strived-for emotional reactions will be missed otherwise.
Read without supposition, All He Ever Wanted will do more than provide a short escape from reality into the world of fiction. It will bring about the reader's own quest for what might have been had that one moment in their own life been handled just a little bit differently...or never have happened at all.","A Lifelong, Emotionally Fatal Obsession",1054857600,,

Nicholas Van Tassel is a stuffy professor at a small college in New Hampshire in the early 1900s.  His stuffiness, at first, rubbed me the wrong way.  But I've been pleased with Anita Shreve's past books and was determined to keep going, despite this.  It was also a little difficult to get used to the way the book is written.  The stilted words as Nicholas tells the story of falling in love with Etna and their life together was an initial drawback, but after the first 40 or 50 pages, I was at ease with it.
This is a sad tale.  A man who only wanted a few choice things in his life, Nicholas has a way of screwing those things up so that even if he gets them, it doesn't make him happy.  He's not a particularly likable fellow although there are certain things about him that make you at least understand him.  It was somewhat refreshing not to have to read about a perfect person since so few of those exist in real life!

In ""All He Ever Wanted,"" Shreve writes from the point of view of a man, Nicholas Van Tassel, who is a college teacher in a small New Hampshire town in 1899. Van Tassel, by chance, encounters a young woman with the unlikely name of Etna Bliss, and he is immediately smitten with her. Van Tassel refuses to listen when Etna insists that she can never reciprocate his love, and he asks her to marry him. This decision will come back to haunt him.
Shreve chose unwisely when she decided to write the book from Nicholas's point of view. He is a pompous, selfish, and shortsighted individual, who for much of the book is blind to his own shortcomings. He makes an unreliable and irritating narrator. The author should have told the book from Etna's point of view, for she is by far the most interesting character in the book. We learn little about Etna's inner life, and what we learn is told from Nicholas's skewed viewpoint.
We do find out that Etna has a secret and tumultuous past, one that she chooses not to share with her husband. Nicholas, who is a pompous chauvinist, does not sympathize with his wife and his clumsy efforts to control her behavior inevitably backfire. Shreve's narrative style is occasionally heavy-handed and overwrought in this novel, and her lack of subtlety weakens the book.
What keeps me interested in reading Shreve's novels is her compassion for her characters. Both Nicholas and Etna are stuck in certain roles, and neither one is flexible enough to change. Since these two individuals are so different from one another, and so lacking in any understanding of one another's needs, their relationship can only bring heartbreak. Anita Shreve has always been an expert at expressing the sorrow of unhappily married couples.",Marrying for the wrong reasons leads to sorrow.,1052006400,,

He begins years earlier with the fire --- the fire that would set his fate.
As crowds escape a hotel blaze, Van Tassel spots a riveting woman under a lamppost. ""There was about her a quality of stillness that was undeniably arresting, and if I close my eyes now,"" he recalls, ""here in this racketing compartment, I can travel back in time more than three decades and see her unmoving form amidst the nearly hysterical crowd."" From the start, Shreve sets up the initial sighting of Etna Bliss as something beyond normal attraction. Van Tassel tells us ""my desire for this unknown woman was so immediate and keen and inappropriate that it quite startled me."" In hindsight, Van Tassel describes his passion as capable of eroding and enhancing character --- in equal measure --- and yet it is the sentence about erosion that is most telling of things to come: ""The erosion the result of the willingness to do whatever is necessary to obtain the object of one's desire, even if it means engaging in lies or deception or debasing what was once treasured.""
Enamored, Van Tassel pursues the aloof Etna immediately and with vigor. He ingratiates his way into her life, which is easy to do in the small quiet town where he has made his life and where there is little else to entertain or distract Etna. A seemingly harmless type --- professorial by vocation and character --- he is, by his own account, loyal and disciplined, even, ironically, when visiting the less savory neighborhood of Springfield, Massachusetts for trysts with women of some reputation. Etna proves to be a formidable mystery, but Van Tassel, who is obsessed, perseveres. They ultimately wed and have children, but Etna remains distant and impenetrable, and Van Tassel suspects that she has known love before him, though he dare not ask. Instead, he lets his jealousy fester. Eventually Etna's past comes to light and collides with Van Tassel's need to totally possess her. A grand scale betrayal ensues, wreaking destruction and devastation on all involved.
Shreve peppers the story with the telltale detail she has come to be known for. Set in the last 19th and early 20th centuries, Van Tassel and Ms. Bliss engage in a proper courtship of afternoon teas, walks in the park and the exchange of books. All the while Van Tassel's desire grows, consumes and seethes below the surface.
Shreve is one of those rare great authors who is equally at ease writing about any period. One sees the clothes, the furniture and the architecture in lively, captivating detail. Even in sharing his want, Shreve shows the reserve appropriate of the time: ""Had it been at all within the realm of possibility, I would have crossed the distance between us and forced her face to mine. I would have dug my hand into the small of her back so that she was pressed hard against me. I would have lifted her skirts and run my hand along her thigh and tucked my fingers into her stocking. I would have done all those things, and perhaps she saw this, for she drew herself together in an instant, as if she had plunged her wrists into icy water. Of course, I did nothing, but I cannot help but wonder what might have happened between us had I been bold enough to touch her then."" Such restraint is palpably evident throughout the book --- and rightly so. It is the tenor of the time and Shreve is a master of time.
The acclaimed talents evident in WEIGHT OF WATER, THE PILOT'S WIFE and Shreve's other works are on full display in ALL HE EVER WANTED. She takes us to another time period with evocative language, in a rich and complex story. Shreve plumbs the depth of desire and love and jealousy in intimate and immediate detail, once again proving her place as a bestselling author.

The archaic prose, the style of the last century, is the first hint to the reader that this tale begins in another time and place. Restricted by Victorian mores, Van Tassel's manner is inhibited and constrained by the particular social customs and strict codes of conscience of the era. Any mention of sexuality is forbidden to Victorians in mixed company and women are protected from life's crude realities, their sensitivities wrapped in a diaphanous cloak of romanticism. Men may be men, with base carnal appetites, but women must remain unsullied, their virginity preserved for marriage. Even then, it is unacceptable for a woman to express any carnal physical needs; a woman's duty is to bear and raise children, creating a nurturing and comfortable home. It is the dawn of a new Century and the world is full of amazing inventions and conveniences, the future brimming with promise. Nicholas Van Tassel, Professor of Literature and Rhetoric at a small New England college, is, at thirty, self-effacing and modestly aware of his shortcomings, not quite handsome and not quite brilliant. One evening when a fire breaks out in the restaurant where he is dining, senses heightened in the moment of incipient danger, Van Tassel notices a particular young woman. From that moment on, he is obsessed with her, unable to find peace until he has captured her attentions. Van Tassel sets his mind to the courtship and marriage of Etna Bliss, sensing that her circumstances are not advantageous enough for her to refuse his suit. He is unable to withstand the compulsion of his desire, aware that Etna does not return his affection, yet undaunted. Etna clearly declares that she does not love Nicholas before she accepts his affections and agrees to the marriage. Like the typical Victorian romantic, Van Tassel is sure Etna will come to love him in time. True to form, he stubbornly denies all semblance of reality, save his own unquenchable needs.
Shreve's protagonist advances from his first insufferable demeanor of propriety, over time, to the reality of his true nature, a base man whose self-importance is so consuming that he is incapable of empathy for another human being. When he marries Etna, Van Tassel knows the bargain does not include her love. By accepting less from his spouse, he, in fact, extracts his pound of flesh, chipping away at the marriage's meager foundation. Bit by intrusive bit, Nicholas suffocates the beleaguered Etna. For her part, Etna has signed her own pact with the devil, never imaging the enormous price she will be asked to pay.
The true nature of obsession is not denied or veiled with romanticism in order to make it bearable. Stripping this particular emotion of any appeal, Shreve acknowledges the truth: deluded by ego into despicable actions, demanding that fate bend to his will with astounding hubris, Van Tassel is unworthy even of the reader's sympathy. The failings he so freely claims are actually conceits, his excuse to blindly pursue his own fulfillment, sublimating all else. Unflinching in the face of such a distortion of love, Shreve pens a story of true obsession without guile or artifice, an obsession as craven and venal as any of the Seven Deadly Sins.

Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.

We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.

In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.

Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600,,

Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.

There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.

Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue.

I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.

The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

 First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.

My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.

4.0,False,"08 26, 2014",A1S68JYEXNETRR,B000FBFMHU,,AustinTiffany,"Like many, I came to this book after having seen the Steven Spielberg movie, eager to hear the story as told by the REAL Frank Abagnale Jr.  I was both pleased and startled by the differences from the movie in this book, but enjoyed the casual and rather frank way Abagnale Jr related his crimes.

No doubt about it: Abagnale was uniquely a product of his time.  While it's entertaining to read his unbelievably brash exploits, one has to remember that most of his crimes took place during the late 50s through the early 70s, long before the Internet, centralized crime databases, ACH systems, or any of the anti-terrorism banking policies existed.  As such, most of what occurs in this book would be all but impossible to pull off today.  Still, a lafge part of Abagnale's success also came from his inflappable confidence, keen eyes, sharp wit, and a little luck.  One key thing his narrative makes clear: the weakest link in any security system is a gullible person, and just acting like you're doing what you're supposed to be doing often dupes people.

The actual narration of the story is quite enjoyable.  While anyone under the age of 40 (such as myself) might not get even half the slang terms and idioms, and while Abagnale has one hell of an advanced vocabulary, his style is easy going, charming, and logical.  Oftentimes, the boom reads less like an autobiography (which it really isn't) and more like a very simple first person novel.

And despite the fact that Abagnale is a shameless womanizer (a fact he makes clear throughout the book) and scammed hundreds of businesses in dozens of countires out of millions of dollars, you can't but help like him.  He seemed to have had a code (he only ever bilked businesses, not individuals ... save for one greedy prostitute), and didn't ever USE anyone per se ... just deceived them.  In fact, even during his years long crime spree, he tried several times to find love, repaid several debts with cash (not fake checks), and regretted some of his actions.

Now, for those wondering, the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr differs from the movie in a number of different ways; in an interview excerpt,  he himself says it is about ""eighty percent accurate"".  In general the movie cut out a lot of time scale, played up the influence his parents had on his initial entrance into crime, reduced the severity of his prison time in France (in a word: torture), and most disappointing, Tom Hanks's character didn't really exist.  In fact, Abagnale states he didn't even meet the FBI agent that had been pursuing him until years later, and the agent had no reason to like him.  In fact, that's part of the reason for my 4 star review; while I understand that reality can sometimes be more boring than fiction, Abagnale's narration is, nonetheless, sometimes less captivating.  In addition, the heavy use of dated slang and sometimes confusing explanations play into the rating.

All in all, a wonderful and entertaining read that's also a bit enlightening, at times emotional, and always vicarious.",A Globetrotting Story of Adventure,1409011200,,

He even went as far as recruiting a small flock of young ladies into believing they were trainee stewardesses and having them pass the bad checks on his behalf.

Frank was eventually caught and held in a French prison which was hell.  He was eventually turned over to the Swedish courts which, according to him, kept him fat, dumb and happy until he was released to the U.S.  There he served more time and then became a special assistant to the FBI for fraud.

He details the history of his life from his humble beginnings conning his own father with a gas card, to his eventual arrest and imprisonment.

There is good humor and bravado throughout, but Frank does make sure to mention how wrong he was in a few points and how many people he unknowingly hurt along the way. He shows some contrition in a few cases

Some of the coincidences and circumstances stretch believability, but the narrative does not suffer for it.

When he describes a con he gives enough detail to follow along, but not enough to perpetrate the con yourself. He even mentions how several of his cons would no longer work thanks to improvements in technology and security.

There is a little strong language peppered throughout the book.

I just finished another reading of it.  There are a lot of things in the book I had forgotten.  Mr. Abagnale raised enough havoc with the banking and police systems in the late 60's and early 70's to make Bernie Madof look like a teenager.  And at the time Frank was a teen-ager.  No wonder Pan-Am went out of business.  Frank probably was one of the main reasons.

Abagnale is quick to admit that his primary motivation for getting into the check-scamming business (which began as a small time bit of credit-card fraud) was getting tail. But if life is unfair to women in this book, it's just as unfair to criminals, business-people, and ultimately to Frank Abagnale.

In fact, ""life's not fair"" is a recurring theme, provided that you accept ""unfairness"" as equal parts favorable and unfavorable. Abagnale's early escapades are fueled as much by unbelievably good luck as they are by his unflappable charm, bravado, and guile. While his primary scam involved being a pilot who didn't have to fly, he also stumbled into three legitimate jobs--albiet on false credentials--first as a doctor who didn't have to practice medicine, then as a lawyer who didn't have to practice law, and finally as a professor who DID have to teach, but who didn't have to know the material especially well. But his fortune would soon change, as at the end of his five year crime spree, he couldn't hole up anywhere in the US or Europe without being recognized. Then his luck gets even worse.

Abagnale's recounting of his nightmarish stint in a French prison almost redeemed the nonchalance of his playboy lawlessness. And make no mistake, this is a book of self-aggrandizement. Despite that, it is a highly addictive read--Abagnale is as charming on paper as he must have been in person. You can't help but smile at some of the stunts he gets away with, although I was mortified at his tenure as a pediatrician (that may just be the new father in me). Still, for all the womanizing and bamboozling, CMIYC is the story of a dumb kid who was too smart for his own good, who started a scam as a lark but found himself painted into a corner with no way out but to keep going before he finally hit bottom. While his antics are infuriating, you still want to cheer him on.

I enjoyed the movie based on this book so I hoped the book would be better. Although the book certainly provided more information about the scams and how he got away with it, Abagnale himself was much less charming in the book. He was too much of a womanizer and a...well...con-man. Emotions weren't expressed (other than relief at escaping one or another of his women), making it difficult to empathize with him. Also, the adult Abagnale (who took part in writing the book) didn't seem to feel much remorse about his activities. He rationalized: ""I never conned a square John out of money,"" but ignores the emotional strain that he must have put on many of his victims. Also, I am a little skeptical of the ""true"" part of this ""true crime"" story. I believe that the basic idea is true, but there were just too many convenient coincidences for his story to be entirely accurate. He must have taken bits and pieces of different escapades and pasted them together into a unified story, and over-emphasized his own cleverness.

Wikipedia doesn't have a definitive answer:

""The authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits were questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that 'Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.'

""In 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part 'I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.'""

So I recommend the reader enjoy the story as historical fiction. Even if half his exploits in the book are true, it's still an astonishing tale of the expert con.  More importantly to me, I can see how in everyday life--in the workplace, politicians, etc--the confidant talker always gets ahead of the shyer guy or gal who actually knows what the heck is going on.  The USA at this time suffers from a crisis of leadership at all levels in all arenas, as we the people rush to follow the smooth talkers, ignoring the quiet facts.","A good enough read, how much is true?",1314403200,,

It's no surprise that he quickly overspends and his account is overdrawn.  Instead of facing the problem, he runs away from it.  His similarity to other teens ends here.

Because he looks ten years older than his true age, Frank is able to pass as an adult.  He learns to make and cash bogus checks and begins traveling around the country disguised as an airline pilot.  His quick wits keep him a few steps ahead of the FBI as he also impersonates a doctor, a lawyer--even on occasion an FBI agent.  The story becomes incredible as he organizes and conducts a phony European ""goodwill ambassador tour"" unwillingly funded by his favorite airline.  Frank is finally apprehended, does time in a series of European prisons, and escapes while being returned to the United States.  His life becomes less eventful as he is finally recaptured, serves more time, and ends up putting his forging skills to work for the FBI to catch other criminals.

Frank's cleverness is impressive as is his casual attitude toward the impersonal institutions and personal friends he cons.  One hopes he has turned into a more considerate adult in his subsequent careers with the FBI and as a white-collar crime consultant in the private sector.

Frank Abignale Jr. was a PanAm airline pilot, attorney, pediatrician, university professor, and millionaire all before he turned 21.

Bravado and nerves of steel go a long way--but research and observation carried the day for Frank and his many aliases.

There is no overriding message to the story. Thieves get caught. The author (and central character) was probably the best young thief in modern history.

Payoffs were stashed in a dozen or more spots all over the world. He logged over a million air miles. Countless women and front-line bank and hotel employees were duped by Abignale's charms.

He blames his short life of crime on a perpetual case of spring fever-where ample loads of cash are needed to fuel this heavenly fire.  A modern day P.T.

Even with the full knowledge that crime doesn't pay, the reader cannot help but cheer Frank on as he ""dead-heads"" his way across the country and eventually around the world.  As his descriptions of his stay in a French prison makes you wonder if any of this free-loading was worthwhile, we commiserate with his dread of being prosecuted by every country in Europe and are pleased when he finally serves his time in the US and actually escapes.

Frank Abagnale tells of his adventures living the life of James Bond without the killing, using his wits and charm to get what he wants. It is romanticized, but plausible.

Do I advise you to read the book first so as to avoid the skew of injecting Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio? You know the successful movie. It is hard not to hear DiCaprio's voice while reading Frank's dialogue. Because the movie has such skilled actors and good editing, it comes across tightly and exciting.

Do I instead advise you to watch the movie first because it will be easier to imagine the details of check fraud production? The book is not well-edited, and suffers from mediocre writing, and any help moving it along will help.

The book is less fun than the movie. There is much more to absorb, more details to consider, and more of Abagnale in the story. His ego plays heavily into the text, and this gets old. His story does not end with this book, but additional chapters haven't been included.

How true is it all? Who can say? Some of it is verifiable, but Abagnale was, in many cases, the only one there. He fabricated so much of his existence, knowing when it is the truth and when it is storytelling is impossible. To enjoy the book, the reader must take the author at his word.

The parental drive Frank wants from Carl feels less evident, missing the sensitive looks and words as played in the movie by Hanks and DiCaprio.

In reading other 'how I lived as a criminal' books by cons like Jack 'Murph the Surf' Murphy, I have had to remember writing skill isn't why they are authors. It is proficiency in thievery, conning, or some other great misdeed. The movie fooled me into believing this book would be different. However, just like Murphy, Abagnale is a man whose life is redeemed. The book doesn't cover this.

There is something oddly heroic about a guy who has managed to fool a lot of people just by pretending. While applauding Abagnale's crimes are wrong, his ingenuity is amazing. He was good enough for the government to cut a deal with him. That's Tom Sawyer with more pluck and style. We wish were that smart and suave. This creates morality layers, but a book worth reading and thinking about.

It gets old reading about how he refined his scam this way or that and then partied with yet another lovely ""fox"" in this or that city. The book is more interesting when he passes himself in other professions (pediatrician, lawyer, sociology professor) and actually manages to bluff his way through actually practicing them for a short time. It's a testament to how anyone with good looks, an air of confidence in what they're doing, a keen sense of observation, and a bit of research can bluff their way through life, although it should be noted that many of his scams would not be nearly so easy in our contemporary world of computer record keeping and instantaneous data transfer. The veracity of his tale is hard to measure, certainly the whole books reeks of exaggeration, but the basic scams sound entirely plausible--whether he was able to pull them off as often or as easily as he makes out is hard to say.
His after-the-fact self justifications mixed with his constant reminders that he only fleeced corporations, not honest individuals quickly get annoying. Abagnale does not write with a great deal of introspection either, he seems to have no motive for his crimes other than financing a luxurious lifestyle and getting his kicks.

I don't know that Chandler ever used the term noir fiction to characterize his work, but I'm a fan of the noir genre, as I understand it, and Chandler was one of the first to produce novels and short stories that merit the noir designation.

Whether in novels like The Big Sleep or Farewell, My Lovely, or stories such as those included in The Simple Art of Murder, the noir world, truth be told, is much like our own.  Hypocrisy, duplicity, vanity, ruthless self-seeking, official corruption, and cruelty, with or without a purpose, are the stuff of which the noir context is made.  Genuine decency, unselfish kindness, generosity, and untainted love are hard to find and commonly devalued as just so much softness.

Chandler's noir protagonists understand all this, and they accept it grudgingly, knowingly, ironically, and often tempered with more alcohol than most of us could handle.  None of Chandler's protagonists, whether his signature character Phillip Marlowe or one of the lesser lights who stand in for Marlowe in some of his stories, has an iron-clad claim to sainthood.  They're sharp dressing chain-smokers who, whatever their unhealthy habits, are well put together, at ease with women, and know how to handle themselves in tough situations.

Nevertheless, while Chandler's protagonists, all detectives of one kind or another, are not clean-living do-gooders, they are imbued with a fundamental integrity, a moral sense that enables them to live as imperfect people in a pretty rotten world without needlessly hurting anyone for fun and profit.  They value humaneness, good-heartedness, and unselfishness when they find these qualities, and they have a keen but understated appreciation for people who are decent and kind.  They can distinguish the usurious malefactors from ordinary folks who have stumbled into trouble and don't know how to get out, and they are inclined to give the latter sort a break, even if it means giving a pass to someone who in a formal-legal sense is guilty of a crime.  Lesser characters than a Chandler protagonist would not develop friendly feelings for a guy like Henry Eichelberger, forthcoming thief that he is.

Whether they go by the name Phillip Marlowe, Johnny Dalmas, Walter Gage, or Pete Anglich, the foregoing is a reasonable typification of Chandler's protagonists.  This may lead some to surmise that Chandler's stories are pretty much the same.  However, while the noir fictional form and the ideal-typical noir protagonist are Chandler's stock in trade, his novels and stories are enormously varied.  Readers of The Simple Art of Murder will learn that murder, whether or not it's really simple, takes many forms, committed by a broad range of people for a wide variety of reasons using methods that, in some creative instances, I'm pretty sure that no one but Chandler ever thought of.

Chandler, moreover, is a master of detail.  His vivid and informed descriptions of people, clothing, furniture, public buildings, flower gardens, tropical fish, homes of the rich and hovels of the poor are beyond the capabilities of most authors, whatever their genre.  On occasion I think that Chandler gives us more detail than we really need, and it may be presented in a vaguely formulaic manner.  However, his ability to so completely and persuasively describe the physical settings of noir fiction adds interest and realism to his stories.  Chandler, without question, was as intelligent and cultivated as authors of more prestigious genres.  Chandler graphically describes the lives and locations of characters from the broad spectrum of social levels in ways that suggest that what he couldn't get through conventional means, from books, he got through planned and unplanned first-hand encounters.  One doesn't get as knowledgeable as Chandler without, from time to time, playing the role of ethnographer of noir.

In truth, Chandler was a literary intellectual of the best sort.  How many other authors appreciate ""sustaining E above high C for an almost incredible period of time,"" especially when it comes out of a trumpet blown by a guy they know to be dissipated, self-absorbed, and an abuser of unsuspecting and vulnerable women?  How many other authors would know how to remove white fungus from the frayed fin of a gold fish without harming the fish?  How many could call to mind the geographical uniqueness of Puget Sound.

These are among the countless observations that Chandler works into his stories to give his characters substance and realism.  I agree that there are times when the flurry of details is so dense that we may temporarily lose the thread of the story, especially since the stories are often complex.  Nevertheless, on balance, Chandler's determination to show us the richly particularized world in which his noir fiction is set contributes substantially to its interest and enables the reader to better understand what is going on.

At the outset, I was inclined to think of the stories in The Simple Art of Murder as exercises that Chandler used to prepare for writing his Phillip Marlowe novels.  However, each of the stories stands alone, complete and distinctive, and in my experience they deserve to be read one at a time, then allowed to sink in before going to the next one.  However, you take them, we see Raymond Chandler at work, producing high quality noir with intellectual integrity and a particularly insightful take on the human condition.  It's not pretty or uplifting, but we can always count on his protagonists, cynical but not thoroughly jaded, to show us something worth caring about.",Short Stories by Raymond Chandler,1423008000,,

The title essay has Raymond Chandler's thoughts on the detective story. Fiction has always tried to be realistic, but tastes change (perceptions of reality). Detective stories often outsell the best-sellers of yesteryear (perhaps because the situations they describe are always current, even if the language and costumes change). Chandler contrasts the writings of Hammett and others to the classic post-WW One fiction (which is usually contained in the houses of the rich and powerful). Chandler lists the problems with A.A. Milne's ""The Red House Mystery"". They are too contrived, and disregard life in the real world. The realism of Hammett (and others) is how they describe the world that is seldom reported in your daily newspaper, except obliquely (""Zoning Board Adopts Changes""). This essay offers wisdom and an overview of detective stories.

 ""Pearls Are A Nuisance"" reads like a satire on detective stories. Walter represents the classic wealthy detective of English fiction, Henry the hard-boiled detective of American fiction. They try to recover a stolen pearl necklace, which is ""Dutch"" (slang for fake). But a high ransom tells Walter they are real. Walter recovers the pearls in a surprise ending.

 ""Spanish Blood"" starts with the murder of a political opponent. A detective is assigned to search the murdered man's country cabin - and finds a dead body! Sam finds an informer and speaks to him before he is shot. Sam follows this lead, but winds up captured. Sam's speech leads to more dead bodies, and the case is now closed. The last pages present the shocking surprise ending.

 ""The King in Yellow"" begins with a musician waking up the whole floor in a hotel. The ""night clerk"" tosses him out; but the musician knows the owner, so Steve is canned. Steve looks up an address, and finds the first body. He meets more people, and finds more bodies. When he returns to the hotel, an old killing is brought up. Following this clue leads to the murderers, and the old scandal that caused them.

 ""I'll Be Waiting"" is about one-night's events at a hotel. A woman checks in and tells the night clerk she's waiting for a visitor. The porter tells Tony that a stranger wants to see him (a warning about another guest). Tony warns this guest, who quickly leaves. But something happens that affects Tony's family.",More Stories About Detection,1414368000,,

It describes the shift in the genre of detective fiction from the neat-and-tidy society popularized by Agatha Christie or even Arthur Canon Doyle to the grittier, darker world mastered by Dashiell Hammett and later embraced by Raymond Chandler.

The works in this compilation are obviously classics of the genre, and were the stepping stones on which Chandler developed his style which was later used in his more famous works, the novels featuring Philip Marlowe.  However, despite that each story on its own, featured in its time as a magazine publication, may have been a success, the compilation is less successful.  With the notable exception of ""Pearls are a Nuisance"", an obvious parody of the characters of Christie's time, and ""I'll be Waiting"", a moody piece which is also substantially the shortest in the collection, the stories here tend to blend together.

None of the works is really a classic mystery in the sense the reader could intuit the outcome.  Instead, the stories focus on the dark, tough-guy sphere of the Los Angeles underworld.  Virtually everyone over the age of 18 smokes, drinks, and carries a gun, and there's nobody under 18.  Eventually a reader gets the view poking a loaded gun into someone's chest was the canonical salutatory gesture of the early 1930's, only later replaced by the handshake.  And it's slightly disturbing how the racism of the time is embedded into virtually all of the stories here.

The strength of the works is Chandler's descriptive prose, which quickly captures the dark mood he's obviously after.  In particular, he opens his stories strongly, sucking the reader in with the first paragraph.  So if you forget about the weaknesses in plot, allowing yourself to instead be captured in the moment of the writing, this book will be more enjoyable.

To be fair to Chandler, these stories weren't intended to be thus bundled.  So for the opening essay, and for the historical niche the stores fill, I give this one 4 stars.  However, I certainly owe Chandler the respect of reading one of his full-length novels before passing judgement on his merits.","classic essay, historical shorts",1278547200,,

Also the business of mixing the Kindle reviews with other reviews is confusing.

This collection of short stories leads off with one essay, Chandler's most famous, ""The Simple Art of Murder.""

None of Chandler's detective short stories except for the very late ""The Pencil,"" featured Philip Marlowe, the hero of all Chandler's books. Chandler effectively stopped writing short stories (again, except for ""The Pencil"") after his first novel, THE BIG SLEEP, in 1939. Some of his later short stories resembled the novels to come, and their heroes were sometimes renamed Philip Marlowe in later reprintings, for example in THE BEST AMERICAN MYSTERY STORIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY's version of ""Red Wind.""

The stories in THE SIMPLE ART OF MURDER, though, are earlier stories, and some of their detectives have characters that would not let them be easily renamed after Marlowe. For example the hero of ""Spanish Blood,"" the first story in this collection, is Hispanic, and that is important to the plot.

Chandler looked on his short stories as apprentice work, but some of these early stories have a kind of power that, though cruder, is also different from the power that appears in the novels. Their detectives are less wittily aloof from the crimes they get involved in, and their lives seem a little dirtier in general. Considering what Marlowe himself goes through, that says quite a bit.

In the beginning was the ...idea. That is Raymond Chandler decided that he had had enough of sweet parlor talk detectives filled to the brim with logical and deductive abilities to solve the crime, the crime of murder if you need to know, before noon and then lunch at the Savoy. Or alternatively solve the dastardly deed before dinner and then reminisce over after dinner brandies and cigars at the club. Nice stuff, nice except murder and its detection is not quite so simple and linear. In fact it is messy, daunting, and done sometimes for reasons that no logical parlor think could fathom. So Chandler once he decided that he needed to air out the room tried to give us a more realistic appraisal of what solving murder (or any crime for that matter) was all about in the real world. And more importantly what kind of guy, what kind of detective guy, and it was mostly guys in his time, could measure up to such tasks.

We all know that ultimately Philip Marlowe, Philip of the seven novels (crime novels if you like but I would argue just novels and let them fall where they may in that genre), who became the proto-type, or one of the proto-types, of the hard-boiled but honest and clever detectives that dominate the genre now. Yes, Marlowe was the quintessential tough private eye but he did not spring up from nowhere and the book under review, The Simple Art Of Murder, a selection of short stories from early in the late-blooming Chandler's literary arsenal put paid to that point. Here Chandler was working out the code that Marlowe will eventually follow, the code of the honest detective doing honest work in this wicked old world in order to bring a smidgen of justice to the cases in front of him.  To make a living as well. And not be afraid to take an occasional bong on the head or a stray slug for the good of the cause.

We see various types of detectives from a house dick I'll Be Waiting to semi-public detective in The King In Yellow to a light throwback parlor private eye in Pearls Are A Nuisance to the hard-boiled bong and slug tough guy in Nevada Gas all trying to work out a suitable code of honor, to not duck when danger is around, to be cynical but focused if necessary and to keep a very long distance from the long arm of the law when necessary. So if you are looking for how an iconic literary and cinematic character began in the churning process this compilation is a primer. And if that isn't enough reason to read this book then the essay The Simple Art Of Murder where Chandler lays down the challenge (along with Dashiell Hammett) to the then current orthodoxy in detection novels (that parlor stuff mentioned above) is more than enough reason to do so.

Oh yah, about Raymond Chandler, about the guy who wrote the book. Like I said in another review he, along with Brother Dashiell Hammett (the author of The Thin Man, and creator of The Maltese Falcon's Sam Spade maybe the most famous tough guy detective of them all. Who, come to think of it, also had a judgment problem when it came to women, although not Hollywood women but up north in Frisco town) turned the dreary gentile drawing-room sleuth by-the-numbers crime novels that dominated the reading market back in the day on its head and gave us tough guy blood and guts detectives we could admire, could get behind, warts and all. Thanks, guys.

In Chandler's case he drew strength from his startling use of language to describe Marlowe's environment much in the way a detective would use his heightened powers of observation during an investigation, missing nothing. Marlowe was able to size up, let's say, a sizzling blonde, as a statuesque, full-bodied and ravishing dame and then pick her apart as nothing but a low-rent gold-digger. Of course that never stopped him from taking a run at one or two of them himself and then sending them off into the night, or to the clink, to fend for themselves. He also knew how to blow off a small time chiseler, a grifter, as so much flamboyance and hot air not neglecting to notice that said grifter had moisture above his upper lip indicating that he stood in fear of something if only his shadow as he attempted to pull some caper, or tried to pull the wool over Marlowe's eyes. Or noticing a frayed collar or a misshapen dress that indicated that a guy or gal was on cheap street and just maybe not on the level.

The list of such descriptive language goes on and on -sullen bartenders wiping a random whisky glass, flighty chorus girls arm in arm with wrong gee gangsters, Hollywood starlet wannabes displaying their wares a little too openly, old time geezers, toothless, melting away in some thankless no account job, guys working out of small-time airless no front cheap jack offices in rundown building s on the wrong side of town doing, well, doing the best they can. And cops, good cops, bad cops, all with that cop air about them of seen it all, done it all blas, and by the way spill your guts before the billy- club comes down (that spill your guts thing a trait that our Marlowe seems organically incapable of having). He had come from them, from the D.A.s office in the old days, had worked with them on plenty of cases but generally he tried to treat them like one might a snake not quite sure whether it is poisonous or not.

At the same time Chandler was a master of setting the details of the space Marlowe had to work in- the high hill mansions and the back alley rooming houses (although usually not the burgeoning ranchero middle class locales since apparently that segment of society has not need of his services and therefore no need of a description of their endless sameness and faux gentility). He has a fix on the museum-like quality of the big houses, the places like General Sternwood's in The Big Sleep or Mrs. Murdock's in The High Window reflecting old wealth California. And he has a razor sharp sense of the arrivisite, the new blood all splash and glitter, all high-ceiling bungalow, swimming pools, and landscaped gardens.

But where Chandler made his mark was in his descriptions of the gentile seedy places, the mansions of old time Bunker Hill turned to rooming houses with that faint smell of urine, that strong smell of liquor, that loud noise that comes with people living too close together, too close to breath their simple dreams. Or the descriptions of the back alley offices in the rundown buildings that had seen better days populated by the failed dentists, the sly repo men, the penny ante insurance brokers, the con artists, the flotsam and jetsam of the losers in the great American West night just trying to hang on from rent payment to rent payment. Those denizens of these quarters usually had a walk on role, or wound up with two slugs to the head, but Chandler knew the type, had the type down solid.

Nor was Chandler above putting a little social commentary in Marlowe's mouth. Reflections on such topics as that very real change after World War II in the kind of swarms that were heading west to populate the American Western shore night. The rise of the corner boys hanging, just hanging, around blasted storefronts, a few breaking off into the cranked up hot rod hell's highway night. The restless mobsters for broken back east looking to bake out in the southern California sun while taking over the vast crime markets. The wannabe starlets ready to settle for less than stardom for the right price. The old California money (the gold rush, gold coast, golden era money) befuddled by the all new waves coming in. And above all a strong sense of the rootlessness, the living in the moment, the grabbing while the grabbing was good mentality that offended old Marlowe's honor code.

And of course over a series of books Chandler expanded the Marlowe character, expanded his range of emotions, detailed his growing world-weariness, his growing wariness, his small compromises with that code of honor that he honed back in the 1930s. Yes, Marlowe the loner, the avenging angel , the righter of wrongs, maybe little wrongs but wrongs in this wicked old world. The guy who sometimes had to dig deep in his office desk drawer to grab a shot or six of whiskey to help him think things through. Marlowe the guy of a thousand punches, the guy of a hundred knocks on the head, the guy who had taken a more than one slug for the cause, the guy who was every insurance company's nightmare and a guy who could have used some Obamacare health insurance no questions asked . Yah, Marlowe.

Original Review

I have reviewed Raymond Chandler's seven Phillip Marlowe detective classics elsewhere in this space so there is no need to go into detail about his place in the detective genre pantheon. What is interesting in this series of short works is that Chandler is working out the 'formula' for what he expects out of his detectives. Those qualities get worked out in Marlowe and thus take their place as very good literary work indeed. Even here Chandler exhibits the sparse but functional dialogue that holds the Marlowe series together. If you have never read Chandler in novel or short story form here is your chance. There will be no place for Agatha Christie-type parlor detectives for you after that. For sure.

If nothing else get this book for his essay that gives this work its title. This is his take at the time (early 1950's)  on the genre's place in the literary pantheon. Now his long ago off-hand remarks are the wisdom of the academy. Enough said.",CHANDLER WARMS UP,1182643200,,

His prose is beyond readable -- it's captivating.  The first book of his I read was ""Farewell, My Lovely.""  I read a couple of paragraphs and I was simply hooked.  The stories themselves are wonderful, but told by a lesser author, they wouldn't be half as good.

The sad thing about Chandler is that he got started rather late in life with his writing and he didn't get that many books written before he died.  Today, you can find about eight books, comprising six novels and two collections of short stories.  ""The Simple Art of Murder"" is one of the short story collections.

Chandler's famous fictional detective, Philip Marlowe does not appear in any of the short stories in this book because these are his earlier works.  They appeared in magazines and he hadn't dreamt up Marlowe yet.  But the stories are so worth reading.  One of Chandler's gifts is his ability to describe people, places and the times without being at all boring.  The net result is that, while you're reading, you're there, back in the Los Angeles of the 1930's and 40's, experiencing how it used to look, how it once felt, what life there was once like.  It's almost intoxicating in its effects.

Those who have read some of the Philip Marlowe novels will find a couple of interesting things.  With a little re-working, you'll find a couple of his short stories in the novels as chapters of the larger works.

One of the really interesting things about this particular collection is the opening work, not a story but an essay entitled ""The Simple Art of Murder.""  It's Raymond Chandler's commentary on what it takes to write a good murder mystery and, believe it or not, it's a very interesting read.  It's entertaining and insightful, not in the least bit dry, and proof positive that Chandler could really write.  The man was truly gifted and not to read him is to missing something excellent indeed.

The phrase ""pulp fiction"" generally conveys something of lesser quality, trash, in fact.  I'll never make that assumption again having read Raymond Chandler, master of the genre.  Few authors in any genre have been able to write as well as he did.",You can't beat Raymond Chandler,1163289600,,

Before you read all the other comments here, please be clear that this book is not like Chandler's other books. Unfortunately, some other people commenting on this book have not read the book - obviously. This book does not contain his character Philip Marlowe. He might have been in the 1968 version, I do not know. Here we have an essay by Chandler called ""The Simple Art of Murder,"" followed by 8 short stories, each about 40 pages long. In some ways, these are a sampling of Chandler's ""other stories."" They still involve an LA based private detective, but each leading male protagonist has a different personality.

The great attraction of this book is the essay by Chandler on how he writes, and what he thinks of other writers. After reading the esssay, I immediately ran out and bought Hemingway's ""Farewell to Arms."" Chandler thought that this book probably has the best prose of 20th century novels. In the essay Chandler tells us about his philosophy to writing crime stories, and he makes comments on other writers from Hemingway to British mystery writer Dorothy Sayers. It is a good essay by Chandler but short.

I have read all 7 Chandler novels plus the short stories ""Trouble is My Business."" One can make the argument that the present book is perhaps his best work; although, the short story format does not make for an impressive read - as we see for example in ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" or other full novels.

As a Chandler fan I read this introduction four times, and read most other stories twice. ""Smart-Aleck Kill"" has a very complicated plot compressed into a very short format. I ended up reading it three times before all the characters were clear in my mind. Eventually the binding of this new book came apart. There is no Philip Marlowe, but this is an excellent sample of Chandler's writing skills.

Chandler wrote detective mystery stories, and became famous for seven novels and a number of Hollywood screen plays, mostly about crime and private detectives in the ""film noir"" genre of Hollywood black and white films, or what is called LA ""pulp fiction"". Far from being an ordinary writer of cheap crime stories, Chandler became one of America's best writers from the mid 20th century. His fame was of course helped by Bogat and Bacall starring in the film ""The Big Sleep"" based on Chandler's first novel.

In any case, this is a book that is not to be missed by Chandler fans. It is simply excellent for anyone else.",I Read It Until the Book Fell Apart,1138579200,,

There are major differences between this edition and the Black Lizard paperback depicted above.  Most significantly, the 1968 version contains 4 stories the Black Lizard paperback does not.)

The Simple Art of Murder is a collection of author favorites culled from short works of crime fiction by the legendary Raymond Chandler.  The title, The Simple Art of Murder, is the same as that of an essay Chandler wrote in 1945.  That essay, which can be found in this book, is a distillation of the author's views on the contemporary state of detective fiction, its future and its limitations.  Whether you agree or disagree with the conclusions it presents, you will find it highly valuable reading, as it explains why and how Chandler wrote as he did.

All twelve stories (remember, this is the 1968 edition) are good and some are great.  Though one of them, Goldfish, takes place mostly in Washington State, they all bring to life the dark, grittiness of Los Angeles' criminal netherworld.  Finger Man, Goldfish, Red Wind and Trouble is My Business all feature the legendary private eye Phillip Marlowe.  These are the 4 stories missing from the Black Lizard edition.

Nevada Gas differs from the rest of the stories in this collection in that the main character is not an investigator but rather a gambler named Johnny De Ruse.  Except for the gentlemanly Walter Gage (Pearls are a Nuisance) all the protagonists of the remaining non-Marlowe stories are very Marlowe-like in personality.  In fact, Johnny Dalmas (Smart-Aleck Kill) seems to differ from Phillip Marlowe in name only.

One of the best stories in The Simple Art Murder is Pick-Up on Noon Street.  In it, Pete Anglisch, a narcotics detective deep undercover, rescues a vulnerable young woman caught up in a complex blackmail scheme.  The captivating Red Wind is also very strongly written.

Just like the Phillip Marlowe novels which brought Chandler his well deserved fame, these hardboiled shorter works are characterized by great dialogue and very effective descriptive passages.

This volume gives us Raymond Chandler's essay of the detective genre plus twelve novellas and short stories basically from the pulp magazines.
Four of these are Phillip Marlowe adventures, all written before the novels.  Of these, ""Goldfish"" and ""Trouble is My Business"" truly stand out.  However, there are three others:  ""Smart-Aleck Kill"" with Johnny Dalmas, the notable ""Guns at Cyrano's"" with Ted Carmady, and ""The King in Yellow"" featuring hotel detective turned private eye Steve Grayce.  Each of these three stories feature a very obvious antecedent to Phillip Marlowe.
Raymond Chandler is noted especially for his concise but rich descriptions of locale and also of characters.  These are practically photographic descriptions.  Also, there's Chandler's dialogue complete with sardonic humor and wisecracks.  The plot is swift paced with nary a dull moment.  He was well trained by BLACK MASK's editor who suggested that whenever the plot threatens to bog down, have a man with a gun in his hand walk into the scene.
Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler shaped the tough private eye genre which spawned Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Richard Prather's Shell Scott, Robert Parker's Spenser, and also today's police detective genre, most notably Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.
Chandler termed this genre, as opposed to the more genteel Agatha Christy type of mystery, ""realistic"".  Well, that's arguable.  I don't know about you, but I don't ordinarily find dead bodies whenever I walk into an empty room, nor are the people who knock on my door likely to have guns in their hands, or even on their persons, so I question the ""realistic"" label.  But these stories are good fun.  The body count is rather high in most of the stories, and you can often figure out who the murderer is by eliminating the characters who get killed along the way.

I did not remember that until the end of the Kindle book where the list of the author's books can be found.

Here I was not remembering I had read Moon before - one of my favorite authors at that time - Moon, McCaffrey, Cherryh - I spent many, many hours reading their works.

I loved this book - and will be purchasing the entire series. Military SF is my favorite genre. Drake, Heinlein, Ringo, Weber, Stirling, Flint, Herbert and of course Moon, McCaffrey and Cherryh.

Much of the plot is boilerplate - the ""strong willed female commander facing unbeatable odds after suffering an unfair, life-shattering setback"" storylines.  Weber's Honor Harrington comes to mind, but honestly I think Moon handles it much better with Kylara Vatta.  Think a mix of Card, Weber and Drake with obvious influences from McCaffrey.

What we have is a protagonist with daddy issues, misunderstood by all, drummed out of the military (in the first few pages so no spoilers)  sent out in near-exile on a milk-run. But her family seems to live by the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, with trade and profit above all and being the driving force of her increasingly hazardous life.

It's an attempt to be the typical young adult learns about herself and her place in the world story, but falls short. The protagonist is so exceptionally neurotic, and wears it on her sleeve, that I find it implausible she'd be seen as any kind of leader. Ky lives in a world where nearly everyone is unhelpful, where apparently despite her father's wealth and influence, doors shut in her face time after time and where mid-level bureaucrats go out of their way to be officious and make enemies. Give me a break. There's a fundamental misunderstanding here of what power and influence are, I think. The author's attempt to show-off Ky's trading skills also fall flat. Moon's idea of a negotiator is someone who browses on-line prices, makes zero attempt at face to face negotiating, and settles for what she is offered. We are told how wonderful Ky is, but nothing I saw (with one violent exception) reinforces that; Moon just can't pull it off. My reaction is too often ""This isn't the way a young person thinks or acts..."" If you're willing to be told (everyone around Ky is more than willing to tell her how impressed they are with her) what to think about her, then you've passed one hurdle in enjoying this book. As the first of a series, perhaps the holes will be plugged in later books. The big problem I have is why doesn't Ky see these holes? The underclassman who sabotaged her - she (and her family!) just shrug off his indirect assault?? Her ""boy friend"" who turns out to be not only a selfish cad (apparently, the concept that one important lesson TEENAGERS learn is to pick their friends, isn't true here) but more than willing to make an enemy for inexplicable motivations. What?!  And where did those two mystery ships go? Why didn't Ky care? I guess I just don't get it. No one seems on the ball enough to see the potential for hostile intent operating behind the scenes? Really? In a world where electronic systems are pervasive, potential hacking is disregarded? Really? Ky is put in a situation where she really should know, based on her training, that she needs help to supervise the ""passengers"" she's given, yet she asks for none. The question you should ask is: is such a blunder - which is a key plot turning point - consistent with how ""wily"" she supposedly is? Ky's only real talent, from what I see, is she's astoundingly financially lucky. She is presented on a plate with money making deals when she needs them, time after time. There seems to be two stories here: one of a wonderkind blazing a path to become a Galaxy class entrepreneur and the other of an average kid who is muddling through the obstacles life throws at her. The first has no bearing (aside from in Moon's mind) with what actually happens, and the second could have made a great story if the protagonist just wasn't so whiny (she talks down to herself constantly).",Clumsy and unconvincing,1470268800,,

In Trading In Danger (Book I), we're introduced to Kylara Vatta, a young woman who comes from a wealthy interstellar shipping family. After she's been kicked out of the Spaceforce Academy, she's given a routine assignment commanding a ship due to be scrapped. However, she has other plans...

I enjoyed Ky's determination to strike out on her own and forge a life apart from her family. Her character and voice are vivid - she's resourceful, stubborn, and trusting. This last quality is what gets her into trouble. Moon keeps throwing obstacles at Ky and it's enjoyable to see how the young captain deals with them.

Books 2-4 continue her story by upping the stakes and introducing new characters. It's wonderful to see Ky mature and develop her leadership talent. Aunt Grace's fruitcakes provide a thread throughout.

Unfortunately, having invested so much in the characters and story, Victory Conditions (Book 5), comes as a disappointment. Moon rushed to finish the series and it shows with sloppy, lazy writing.

Review of Series
I marathoned through this series and literally couldn't put it down. It's a highly entertaining sci-fi adventure story. Moon does an especially good job with the military aspects, especially the ins and outs of communications during war and the choreography of space battles.

For many reasons the series, especially the first volume, invites comparisons with Lois Bujold's Vorkosigan series, which unfortunately spotlights the weaknesses here: the shallowness of the overarching allegory, a general lack of humor and the corresponding absence of irony that implies (with the notable exception of everything to do with the dog, Puddles/Rascal,) villains about as interesting as Sauron's eyeball o' flame, little interest in or distinctiveness to the secondary characters.

In general, I am not a fan of hugely ambitious sci-fi allegories, what I usually label ""Dune yada yada,"" but the lack of any larger stakes than ""WE MUST DEFEAT EVIL"" did in the end make this series less than it could be. To give just one example, the story hints at some of the difficulties female officers face--people are always assuming that Ky has fallen in love with any handsome man who comes her way--but it doesn't go any further than that, for example by really getting into the sexism of military culture or (like Bujold's Beta Colony) trying to imagine a culture where gender is mostly irrelevant.

Well written, by an author who knows her stuff.

In most of her books her primary character is a strong, intelligent female in a non-traditional role and the few that aren't feature them. While often required to stand fast in order to find and hold their place, there is no overt feminism, the characters are simply themselves.
She should be required reading for all young women as they would realize whole world's of choices are open to them they were previously unaware of. They've only to decide, then do. Thank you, Ms. Moon.

Once again, Moon gives us an underestimated female protagonist who discovers herself to be tough and resourceful. It may be something of a formula for her, but she does it very well, and I don't mind it. The plot clicks along at a good pace, and the minor characters are sufficiently varied.

This book's main character, Ky Vatta, may have a bit more to learn, a more significant failing to overcome, than some of Moon's comparable characters -- and that's just fine.",Another well-crafted and enjoyable military SF novel from this author,1381017600,,

She's young and enthusiastic, perhaps a bit too trusting, and prone to fits of hot-headedness.  The youngest of five siblings, and the only girl in a wealthy and successful family, all Ky really wants is to make a name for herself.  Lacking any real experience, she often is forced to rely on her own instincts and intuition, which turn out to be surprisingly good most of the time.  In other words, Kylara is just the kind of person we love to cheer for.

I like the way Ky handles herself in tough situations, although some of those situations are a little too contrived for my liking.  In the naval academy, Ky tries to help a friend who, as it turns out, was trying to discredit the military, and she is expelled.  That punishment was way more severe than necessary, but the scene does serve to show us that Ky is a good-natured person who truly wants to help people whenever possible.  Later on, Ky inadvertently takes her ship and crew into a star system where war is breaking out.  Many of the events that transpire from this don't make much sense logically, but again they serve to give us more insights into Ky's nature, namely that she is a capable captain and will do whatever is necessary to protect her ship and crew.

The real saving grace to Trading in Danger is the audio production.  Graphic Audio specializes in turning books into full cast dramatizations, complete with music and sound effects. This particular production was beautifully done, with sound and music that truly enhance the story rather than distracting the listener.

As to the cast, what you have basically is a main narrator, and several voice actors who read the parts of the various characters.  The main narrator, and I believe also the voice of Kylara, is Cynthia Holloway, who did a more than adequate job.  The other actors are too numerous to name here, but I'm happy to say that they are all named in the recording.  That makes me happy because sometimes full-cast audio productions neglect to name the actors, so thank you for that Graphic Audio.

This is the second time that I've had the pleasure of reading 'Trading in Danger' and I must admit I loved it as much, if not more than when I read it for the first time. In thinking this, I realise that it is most probably because the first time - if I recall aright - I practically devoured the book in one sitting! This time I had the time to savor and enjoy all of Ms. Moon's nuances in her storytelling; And good story-telling at that.

What I liked: As any good book does, this one starts off with intrigue in the very first paragraph. What's great about the story is that the intrigue never stops. It may slow, or even hit a bit of a lull, but there's more than enough going on that you just HAVE to know what's going to happen next... or how will that problem be overcome; or even can it be overcome? I liked that very much.

(Sorry if this review is a little hurried, but I'm hanging out to get into my library to see if I have book two, or if I loaned it from the library. If the former, then YAY, if the later, then I do so hope I can afford the eBook on Amazon. *sigh*)

What I didn't like: Not a thing.

Oh, as per usual, editing: My recall of the editing was that I found nothing wrong. No spelling mistakes, or grammatical gaffs at all - and I was reading it at an unusually slow pace... for me.

So please, do yourself a favour, if you haven't had the privilege of reading one of Ms Elizabeth Moon's stories, grab this one, cop a squat someplace and enjoy!

""Of course we didn't do autopsies. We know exactly what killed them -- I killed them!""

Kylara Vatta, daughter of the head of the most prestigious shipping empire in the universe, didn't want to follow in her family's footsteps -- trading is boring and Ky wants adventure and her own life outside of her family's control. So she opted for a military career. But with only a few months left in the officer's academy, she was set-up, betrayed, kicked out, and publicly shamed. When she returns home in disgrace, Vatta Transport is happy to have her back in the fold. Her first assignment is to captain a derelict spaceship straight to the junkyard, but Ky has Vatta blood in her veins and can't pass up an advantageous business opportunity that arises unexpectedly. When this leads her into various forms of danger, and when scammers and mutineers think they can take advantage of the young and inexperienced captain, Ky finds that her time spent in the military academy wasn't wasted after all.

Trading in Danger is the first installment of Elizabeth Moon's VATTA'S WAR military science fiction epic. I don't think this series will appeal to everybody, but it happened to hit a sweet spot for me. I like Kylara Vatta, an intelligent ethical rules-bound military officer with a soft heart who, due to her new circumstances, is beginning to discover that she has a rebellious streak, not to mention a disconcerting appreciation for quickly solving problems with violence. Ky is a little passive and occasionally bewildered in this installment, but this is her first adventure. I'm assuming that Moon plans to show us some growth in this area as Ky begins to adapt to her new lifestyle. Kylara's crew and family members are also likeable -- especially elderly Aunt Grace who bakes unappetizing but invaluable fruitcakes.

The plot is engaging, unpredictable and mostly quick-moving though some of the dialog gets repetitive as Ky explains what's going on to multiple characters who show up at different times. I enjoyed the focus on transportation, though this may be a personal thing. My husband runs a small freight logistics company, so there's a lot of talk about contracts, cargo, carriers and consignees in my little world, and I was fascinated by how this might scale up to apply to an entire universe. Surprisingly, this was one of my favorite aspects of the story but, again, that's just me. (It would be such an awful pun to say ""your mileage may vary"" so I won't.)

Trading in Danger is ""soft"" science fiction, or ""space opera"" -- it's a little fluffy, focusing on drama and political intrigue, not physics. There's talk about FTL drives and ansibles (there's a nod to Ursula K. LeGuin), but no explanation of how they work. I love physics but have to admit that I get bored by long dry theoretical or technical discussions of astrophysics and quantum mechanics. Trading in Danger is a quick and easy read for when you're in the mood for some non-challenging science fiction. It ends on an intriguing note -- Ky has some difficult choices to make about her relationship to her family business. Should she stay with Vatta or go rogue? Whatever, I'm still on board and ready for the ride.

Exactly what happened, and why it's a Bad Thing, is never really explained, but Ky ends up taking the heat and is thrown out. Luckily (or not), she's the younger daughter of a wealthy space mercantile company and her father and uncle pack her off on a routine voyage -- her first command, though a very small one -- to remove her from the public eye and the reach of the media. And, since she's a Vatta, her elders are pretty sure she'll stray from the job they gave her in search of trade and profit, since they all did the same thing their first time out. Sure enough, Ky and her ship and her small crew (the senior members of whom have been given a certain amount of babysitting to do) take on a contract that leads them off their assigned mission, and into a suddenly erupting war zone. And the action proceeds from there, more or less satisfactorily, most of the time. Moon has a military background herself and is quite capable of producing headlong adventure with strong female characters (the Deed of Paksenarrion trilogy comes to mind), but this one seems rather bland, somehow. The style is meant to be introspective from young Ky's point of view -- will she ever get people to take her seriously? -- but comes off being superficial, somehow. There's no real science here, either, the technology of FTL and all that being passed over in jargon, but that's a tradition in SF juveniles.

I am glad that I did.

Set in a space opera universe of FTL travel, ansibles for FTL communication, and a balkinized polity of trading planets, pirates, mercenary companies and more, Trading in Danger is the story of Kylara (Ky) Vatta. Unlike her trading oriented family, she's more interested in a military career. This career path goes off the rails in the first chapter of the book, as she is cashiered out of the military academy for what seemed to be an innocent attempt to help a fellow classmate.

Scandalous!  Her family decides that a change of scenery and away from the media lights of her home planet of Slotter's Key. The Glennys Jones is one of the oldest ships in the Vatta trading fleet and due for scrap. Send Ky to captain the falling-apart ship for one last mission, with the end point of the mission having the ship being scrapped on a distant planet, and have her charter transportation back home for her and her crew. In the meantime, the scandal will have been forgotten

Simple, right?

Although she assiduously avoided joining the family business to this point, Ky cannot resist the chance to make some ""trade and profit."" And in the quest for that, winds up in an unfamiliar solar system that is just about ready to break out into civil war...

Moon is the sort of space opera writer that reminds me of Bujold in many ways. The technical details are plot oriented and relatively general in their details. Readers looking for lovingly thought out technical details of an FTL drive are going to be disappointed here. The technological details here serve character development and plot. And it is there, especially the character development, that Moon shines. Ky is a fully formed and envisioned three dimensional character, who has strengths, weaknesses, personality and who grows and changes in the course of the novel. Even when she does the wrong thing (for the right reasons), she is a sympathetic viewpoint character and Moon makes her the hard core of the novel. Her secondary characters are also well drawn as well, and contrast well against Ky, ranging from her family, to her crew, to those she tangles with in the course of her story.

The pacing is a bit slow as far as the action goes, its clear Moon is more interested in character development and starting the building of her world here than anything else. I was never precisely bored, but there are stretches that are less action packed than others. I also suspect that there might have been a larger book here that Moon decided to trim. Some subplots and ideas are mentioned and dropped in, but not fully explored. This may be a case of Chekov's Law, as applied to subsequent novels.

Speaking of subsequent novels, despite the relatively minor detractions, I definitely be looking to continue to read Ky's story in the subsequent novels in this series.",Solid Character-based Space Opera,1259107200,,

Given a seemingly easy task of delivery a ship to the wreckers, Ky decides instead to save the ship and try to repair/purchase it with the funds she makes trading on the way. During this time she picks up a few marooned spacers who cause trouble and which results in some all new problems and opportunities.

I felt this story started off very weakly. I almost did not continue because I found the scenario at the academy incredibly silly and far-fetched. If she's going to get kicked out, I would've preferred it for an actual mistake, rather than because something someone beyond her control did... It seemed like the author was afraid to make her character less than perfect.  Also it seems like it's always MEN who mess with Ky.  This happens several times in the book.  It got a bit old.

Ky herself is a bit of a Sue. Everywhere she goes people comment on her age, and precociousness. Also, there is a distinct lack of decent young male characters. They are either irrational (like her ex boyfriend, the marooned youngster, or the guy who gets her kicked out), or older. The villains are a bit one dimensional. Although Ky herself acknowledges she was a spoiled brat, she refuses to try to be diplomatic in the way she handles the spaceship captain who was her 'journeyman' mentor. I felt that Ky continued to be a bit of a brat in the way she had dealt with this man.

In fact I really had no inclination to even try and read anything by Moon.  Not because I didn't like her writing, or heard bad things.  Nope, I just hadn't heard anything about her.  I was ignorant.  So I couldn't have been more happy to find that I enjoy Moon's style of writing and ability to truly create a real and believable story.

Moon writes straight to the point.  There are no pages long diatribes and/or explanations that do nothing more than bog a story down.  Don't get me wrong.  If done correctly, that can work.  Neal Stephenson comes to mind.  But it can fail just as often as it could work.  Neal Stephenson comes to mind.  But with Moon she is to the point, there is no beating about the bush.  we don't have to read through a hundred pages to cover a span of 2 weeks, but mere sentences would suffice in summing up all that was important and relay it to the reader, all the while not cheapening the storyline.

Ky is an altogether believable character, one that I at times admired and cheered along, feeling as though I were going through the motions of a first time captaincy.  Her interactions with Gary and Quincy and the other officers and staff was not forced or unbelievable, but accurate (seemingly at least, after all I have never been on a space ship) and to the point.  Her interactions with her family were honest and heartfelt, and I couldn't but nod my head in recognition of her family life.

I am gushing a bit about Moon's Vatta series in part because I had not expected anything when I stumbled upon her book.  Without expectations I was left to enjoy her book for what it was.

At Belinta, Ky learned that the planet had ordered agriculture ""ag"" equipment over a year ago from Sabine Prime which was picked up by another transport company and never delivered. Belinta was desperate for the equipment. No one named Vatta had ever turned down a chance to profit and Ky was no different. Ky hoped to earn enough money so that her ship could be repaired instead of scrapped. Once the personal contract was signed, she was off to Sabine Prime.
Sabine Prime gave Captain Vatta a bit of trouble, but not much, at first. Ky needed a new FTL drive before she could go anywhere. It was a vital part of the ship. Then she needed to purchase the ag equipment. The problem was figuring out how to get the money. FTL drives were very expensive. It all became worse when chaos erupted. Someone blew up the ISC's ansible platforms, so communications was all but gone. Then war ships came in. Ky's ship had no weapons and, with no FTL drive, no way to leave.

How could the Master Sergeant have guessed exactly what Ky would need? And how did Ky persuade herself not to crack the obvious code that he left her? I also expected a bit more of a bang from the frequently mentioned fruitcake. This type of 'artifact' is common in first drafts but an author with Moon's skills normally eliminates them before the novel sees the printing press.
Despite its slow start and some extraneous pieces, TRADING IN DANGER is a generally satisfying read and Ky makes an interesting and multidimensional character.",Pretty good action story with fine 3-dimensional character,1070841600,,

Kylara Vatta is a member of a well respected trading family on Slotter Key. Despite, or maybe because of, her family's efforts to dissuade her, Ky is a senior cadet in the planet's spaceforce academy. She has exchanged rings with Hal, who has been trading the top class position with her since they joined the academy.

Now she has been called to the Superintendent's office and asked to resign because an underclassmen has complained on a public news outlet that the academy is unfairly treating his religious group. Ky had thought that she could trust him, but he deliberately took advantage of her gullibility for his own purposes. Ky had been warned by MacRobert, one of the senior NCOs, but had trusted her own feelings too much to believe him. Moreover, MacRobert seems to have presented some sort of message for her in a ship model kit, but she doesn't bother to figure it out.

A Vatta company car picks up Ky at the Academy front gate while MacRobert has the media reporters lured away to the back. She is driven to the company airfield and then flown back home. There she is fussed over, plied with new clothes, and offered the captaincy of an old ship being flown to the scrapyard on Lastway. She will have a preordered cargo for Belinta and spec cargo for Leonora.

Of course, as a brand, spanking new captain, Ky considers the odds of making a profit on the voyage and then bringing her ship up to standards. When she hears from Belinta Customs that they have an agricultural machinery shipment mislaid by Pavrati Interstellar, Ky immediately starts thinking of ways to fetch the missing shipment for the planetary government. After some concentrated negotiating, she unloads her spec cargo and heads for Sabine, the nearest source of ag machinery. Unfortunately, the FTL drive starts falling apart and then Sabine circumspace becomes a warzone. Later the combatants dump fifty hostages in her ship, albeit under contract and with auxiliary materiel and supplies, but still a strain on the ship and crew.

This story is a form of trial by happenstance, with Ky performing well personally, but having problems with some of the extra people on board. Ky has a reputation for adopting underdogs, but her real problem is that she naively trusts people who appear trustworthy. Her experiences during this voyage, however, seem to have instilled a much needed touch of cynicism in her character.

Although Ky is a merchant captain, her experiences as an officer cadet prove to be very valuable during this voyage. She also gets a opportunity to face down several people who consider her little more than a naive, inexperienced girl. A tough trip, but enlightening.

This is supposed to be the first in a new series. The author is going to have to be exceedingly clever to continue this pace in future volumes, particularly since Ky is only a merchant captain. However, the mercenary company that hired her to house the fifty hostages has actually made an offer of a commission in their unit. Ky might not be a civilian much longer.

Highly recommended for Moon fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure among the spaceways with interesting characters and tense situations.

I was sorry to see the story end, especially as no clear conclusion was reached. That's okay, I'm a grownup, I can handle there not being a defined ending (I've given up on happy endings). Without giving any spoilers, a few thoughts:

Tim Winton is so detailed and thorough that you get a sense of every detail in the scenes. The weather, the feel of the dust on your skin, the smells of the eucalyptus, as well as the emotions of the character are felt, not simply read. I didn't care for the main female character, I thought she was unsympathetic and apathetic to other characters, even the one she loves. The male lead is great, but of course, it's fiction! He has to be THAT perfect to make it work.

The main themes are overcoming your own personality flaws, and the fear of being left behind. Winton's main character Lu has lost everyone he loves; on this journey he meets several characters that could represent those faces from his past. He also has to face the reality that his own perceptions from the past may have been wrong. Horrifyingly so.

Rumor has it that this will become a film. Rachel Weisz is signed to play Georgia, which sounds fine. But there is a bit of a mystery regarding Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell. IMDB, the movie database, lists Colin as playing Lu. However, another report says Russell would play Lu. The other main male character, Jim, is pretty fascinating: he could be played by Russell but defintely not Colin. So I'm not sure which is accurate. I hope that Russell plays Lu, but he could do the character Jim Buckridge with a bit of a evil streak which might be interesting to see.

I'd be very interested to see how a screenplay could be written to show the amount of time passing as well as do justice to the Australian terrain and the long stretches without dialogue. My first reaction was that it would be compared with Tom Hank's Castaway. I think Russell could carry that, I don't think Colin has that much depth.

Anyway, this book had me take out the atlas, the dictionary, and use Google several times to see the trees and earthforms he describes. I think a geologist would particularly like this book, lots of rock talk.

Lastly, I've noticed that in the three Winton books I've read that Winton seems to idolize children, almost in a mythological way. That's not a bad thing, but it just seems that the children in his books develop almost a fairy like quality of mystery and perfection",magical,1262217600,,
5.0,True,"09 11, 2009",ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000FC0NI2,,Andrew Ellington,"I'm really starting to consider Australian literature to be some of the best fiction I've had the pleasure of getting my hands on.  I've already been able to delve into authors like Murray Bail and Elliot Perlman and now I've had the pleasure of reading a stunning novel, `Dirt Music', written by acclaimed Australian author Tim Winton.  I must say this; after this read I surely will be researching his bibliography.

`Dirt Music' takes place in a small fishing town in Western Australia (a fictitious town called White Point) where middle-aged Georgie Jutland is trying to find herself.  She's always been a rebellious and free-spirited woman; at odds with her family constantly, never truly feeling as though she belonged anywhere.  She's longed for a sense of freedom that everyone around her seems to take away, but she lacks the ability to make the needed effort to really save herself from her apparent failings.  She lives with widower Jim Buckridge; a shell of a man who drowns himself in fishing and remains a distant and reclusive mystery to Georgie.  She feels as though she loves him, but she struggles with understanding why.  She cooks for him, she cleans his house and she takes care of his two sons, but at the end of the day she feels alone and cold.

And then she meets Lu.

The man known as Luther Fox comes with some serious baggage.  A beautiful musician who comes from a dishonorable family; Fox has been reduced to a shamateur (fish poacher) due to some unspeakable tragedies in his life.  Let's just say that he his the sole survivor to the Fox name.  When Georgie spots Fox poaching late at night it is her obligation to inform her husband, a local fisherman.  This is their way of living and this man is encroaching on that.  Instead of playing informant she decides to play desperate housewife and starts up a heated affair that is far more than just a one-night stand type thing.  No, it becomes apparent that both Lu and Georgie fill a void within one another; a void they've been trying to fill for a long time.

The novel effortlessly paints these characters for us, giving us a realistic and authentic portrait of middle-aged despair and self-awareness.  Winton's descriptive prose is littered with beautiful expressions of pure emotion and his languid delivery is a joy to read.

My one critique, if I were to have any, would be that at times he expounds too much on areas that need little expansion.  He goes to great lengths to flesh out each and every move these characters make, and the prose spans over a good length of time, and so some scenes could have been cut and some time could have been shortened to keep the pacing a little brisker in areas, but in the end it is a trivial complaint when you consider the richly rewarding entirety of the novel.  I felt that the novel's ending was a tad premature (even if the novel spans nearly 500 pages), but it was not a disappointment in the least; it just felt a little too sudden for what I was expecting.

Some novels take a full chapter to wind things down; this one almost feels like the ending is on a solitary page.

It's still the best thing I've read in quite some time, and certainly a masterful example of pure storytelling at it's finest.  I'd highly recommend this one.  If you enjoy a good dramatic story, filled with love, loss and ample amounts of genuine (and realistic) tension then dive right in, for `Dirt Music' covers all those bases and then some.",A beautifully sung song of self discovery...,1252627200,,
5.0,False,"08 16, 2009",AJQ1S39GZBKUG,B000FC0NI2,,Alysson Oliveira,"Tim Winton's mesmerizing ""Dirt Music"" opens quoting Emily Dickinson about different kinds of solitude. This opening is not by chance, because for more than 400 pages the novel will handle different kinds of solitudes that befall on its characters. Above all, it is about that old solitude, the loneliness, which defies us.

Winton has a prose deep in details that reads almost like something hallucinatory. We dive beneath the surface and meet a world of melancholy inhabited by Georgie, her husband, Jim, and a strange figure called Luther Fox. These three people are trying to overcome their limitations, their pains, and the reader is invited to follow their journey.

It is an invitation one cannot refuse, because Australian writer Winton beautifully infuses it with local colors and language that make it a very absorbing reading. Any reader can easily relate to the struggle of the trio of characters because they are very real.

The problem doesn't lie with the story but with Winton's language which others may find poetic and lyrical, but just seems jarring and obscure to me. His characters spit out half sentences, phrases, punctuated by local slang and references that nobody unfamiliar with the Australian outback will be able to understand.

Notwithstanding, ""Dirt Music"" has a decent story going about two people, one unhappy and listless in a loveless marriage, the other strung out and catatonic with grief after a car accident which wipes out his entire family, how they ignited the last spark of life in each other when their paths crossed one day, with devastating consequences. Damaged people recognise and are drawn like magnets to each other, Winton seems to be saying.

Surprisingly, Georgie and Lu share very little page space. Whereas Georgie's past and character is revealed in words, Winton relies on language and imagery to express Lu's situation, which lies buried beneath his deep freeze reserve. Lu's solitary flight into the wilderness may be key to the story but it goes on for far too long and becomes interminable. The Georgie chapters are far more satisfying.

I loved the way the inner life of the characters unfolded, revealing so much through action and reaction.

Luthor is one of the most original characters I've met in a book. He was a revelation. His self imposed trials, endured in the wilderness, at first so meaningless, becomes profound as the experience unfolds for us to share.
Georgie is a woman as lost to her needs, as Luthor is lost in the tropical jungles. No sense of herself, no grasp on what she really wants, her quest to find Luthor is really a quest to find herself.

Tammany Hall controls the city.  Even the mayor is a puppet for corrupt politicians.  Factory workers  put in long hours  in squalid sweatshops for low pay.  Gangsters and criminals roam the city looking for easy prey.  Homeless children sleep in alleyways.  Prostitutes, con men and corrupt policemen are everywhere.  As one character in the novel says, ""Everyone has a racket in this town.""

Baker contrasts the struggle of life in the city with the fantasy world of the Coney Island amusement parks.  He describes how each summer the people of the city come to shrug off their cares and embrace the hedonistic pleasures of the parks.

To tell his story, Baker uses a large cast of interesting characters.  Each character has a unique point of view.

Some of Bakers memorable characters are:

Essie who escapes the drudgery of work in a sweat shop by having an affair with a gangster hiding out in Dreamland.

Kid Twist who came to America by walking across Europe and stowing away in ship bound for New York.

Big Tim Sullivan who is a corrupt Tammany politician.  He controls saloons, gangsters, and the Mayor of New York.

The Great Head Doctors from Vienna who are Sigmund Freud and his protege Carl Jung.  They give a European perspective to the chaos of New York.

Trick the Dwarf is the narrator of the story.  Trick sometimes enters regular society by passing as a young boy.  He experiences the best and worst times of the Dreamland amusement park.

For me, this novel was a long slow struggle to finish.  I kept reading because I wanted to find out how Baker resolved the plot lines.  Spoiler Alert - He doesn't.  He brings the story to an end, but there is no great climax.  And perhaps  that is the point.  In real life not all of our plot lines are resolved.  We may escape reality for a while, but life goes on.

I assisted in small ways and got to know the performers whose features and  disabilities would have them sent them to institutions rather then allowing them to make a living, performing.  Backstage is never glamourous but can be a rich experience. It took me back there a little. Although written about the turn of the century when carneys were much tougher and life was difficult (think Gangs of New York) it is not aimed at the seedy side, rather the living adventure of a time without government control.  A time of invention and discovery.  A time of hope and especially the building of Coney Island Amusement Park",Fascinating,1311206400,,
4.0,False,"11 7, 2007",A319KYEIAZ3SON,B000FC11II,,Mary Whipple,"Set at the turn of the twentieth century in New York City, Dreamland captures the dreams of its immigrant populations and the realities of life in the factories and tenements, the hopes of its marginalized residents and the pathos of their lives, the power of police and politicians and the venality of their public commitments. The nascent union movement, the Tammany Hall ""fixers,"" and corrupt police exist side by side with the arrival of Freud and Jung on a college speaking tour, the excitements promised by carney barkers in the fanciful ""cities"" at Coney Island, and the growth of young love.

Filled to the brim with historical detail which brings the city to brutal, and sometimes grotesque, life, the novel focuses primarily on four characters: Gyp the Blood, a young thug who exists on the margins of organized crime; Kid Twist, a young stowaway who arrives from Europe seeking a better life; Trick the Dwarf, who often impersonates a child in his scams; and Esther Abramowitz, a young woman who supports her studious rabbi father by working twelve to fourteen hours a day as a seamstress at the doomed Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.

As Esther works, becomes a committed union member, and falls in love with Kid, we see the plight of women who must fulfill family responsibilities at enormous costs to themselves, and as we come to know her family, we see the various paths taken by its members as they carve out a place in life. Her relationship with one of the city's many prostitutes illustrates the desperation of some women who are on their own, and how close she herself is to the dividing line between them. Kid Twist, though more thoughtful, is not far from the brutal Gyp in his efforts to control his life, and Trick the Dwarf, while yearning for a ""normal"" relationship, scrabbles about among the city's lowlife trying to find a place in the world.

Baker is a master of odd details from the period, filling the novel with wide-ranging historical background and developing his characters just enough to make the plot seem plausible, despite its remarkable coincidences, and its sense of melodrama. The picture of humanity here is dark, with many scenes designed to shock. The mob's delight in torture, the factory owners' abuse of workers, the brutality of protection rackets, the sudden devastating fires, and the bleakness of everyday life are sustained for almost seven hundred jam-packed pages. Told in lively prose which never flags, and filled with crisp dialogue (and dialect), the novel's dozens of action scenes create an indelible picture of the turn of the century when life was cheap. n Mary Whipple

It's the same guy, but Baker has the chops to do both, as he is the chief historical researcher for the NEW YORK TIMES.

 As I began to read, I was immediately reminded of several other books. AMERICAN TRAGEDY, THE ALIENIST, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, and even CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The setting is New York City with Coney Island featured most of the time. There are gangsters and factory girls and Tammany Hall politicians and they all speak their own unique language, some Yiddish and Bowery slang. Thankfully I checked out the back of the book. Sure enough, there was a glossary. You'll be paging back and forth for the entire read.

 There really isn't any main character, but Esse Abramowitz; her brother ""Gyp the Blood;"" Esse's lover Josef Kolykia, alias ""Kid Twist;"" and Tammany Hall politician Big Tim Sullivan do most of the heavy lifting. Trick the Dwarf tells the story. There is a dramatis personae provided at the beginning to help you keep track.

 The plot begins when Kid Twist saves Trick the Dwarf's life at a Rat Bating by nailing Gyp the Blood with a shovel. For the rest of the book, Gyp the Blood is out to get Kid Twist. A subplot involves Esse Abramowitz's increasingly involvement in the Labor movement. She also works at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co., and if you're up on your history, you know what happened there.

 I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Trick the Dwarf suggests what MIGHT have happened to the major actors, rather than telling us. There's also a subplot involving Sigmund Freud that seems to be included just to add some historical credence. As Baker tells us in his acknowledgments, Freud really did visit America in 1909, but his conflict with Carl Jung doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything.

The reader may experience more verisimilitude as a result, but that does not, nor should it, relieve the author of the obligation to edit. The novel is overlong, in what may be a misguided attempt to fool readers into believing they're getting a better deal for their money.

Good stories should not be required to support more side trips than are necessary. Nevertheless, long though it may be, this is a cracking good story, and for the most part well told. Bennie Rosato is a prominent, successful, criminal attorney who runs her own law firm in Philadelphia. It is a firm of women lawyers, some of whom come with considerable family baggage. Rosato is not excluded. She never had the standard nuclear family, her father apparently split long before Bennie had any real memories of him. Her mother is dying in a nursing home and Bennie has no one with whom to share that burden.

With only a week to go before the trial starts, drug dealer Alice Connolly, a woman accused of murdering her cop-lover, demands a new lawyer, specifically, the woman she claims is her twin sister, Bennie Rosato. Rosato has always known she was an only child. When Rosato meets with Connolly, loudly claiming a frame-up by the Philadelphia PD, she learns to her considerable and additional consternation that Connolly has been guided to the decision to contact Bennie, by an old man who claims to be the women's father. This can only be the case, of course, if Connolly is in fact, Bennie's sister.

Connolly is one of the most interesting characters in he book. Street-wise, tough as nails and amply capable of murder, her first and only priority is to use this possible connection with Bennie Rosato to get off and out from under the death penalty that goes with conviction.

Rosato, still wondering after many years of self-examination, what her family might have been, is forced by circumstances to renew the old questions and try to find the man claiming to be her father. Scottoline, a good writer, expertly weaves into the book, the story of the cloying, overly protective family of one of her associates as stark contrast to her own fragmented family. But having established her context and parameters, it's almost as if the author wants to be sure everyone who reads Mistaken Identity gets it. Readers will get it too.

The resolution, to family questions, to Connolly's claim of a frame and the murder trial itself, are all resolved in interesting ways and the book is ultimately properly completed.",Okay Mystery is Too Long,1390089600,,

4.0,False,"10 30, 2013",A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B000FC14DU,,Rocco Dormarunno,"In Lisa Scottoline's ""The Vendetta Defense"", Judy Carrier went and did it: she took on a case that she had no business (as in it was not part of Rosato & Associates' legal business) taking. Judy agreed to defend a man accused of murder who admits to killing--not murdering--his lifelong nemesis, in fulfillment of a vendetta. Pigeon Tony freely confesses to the crime but sees no crime in it. There are mitigating circumstances which go back to Mussolini-era Italy and reach out to a crime committed just a year before the action of the novel takes place. (Ms. Scottoline is to be applauded for vividly bringing to life this tense period.) However, none of this will matter in court if Pigeon Tony testifies, which is what he wants to do. He fails to see why he should be punished for administering a justice he so clearly sees. This is not a murder mystery so much as a ""How do you defend the murderer?"" legal thriller.

All this creates an extremely tense, frustrating and frightening case for Judy. The threats are everywhere from the aggrieved family of victim Angelo Coluzzi and its heavy-weight goon, Jimmy Bello.

The writing is fairly swift, occasionally getting bogged down with a little too much exposition into the intricacies of pigeon raising and racing. The juxtaposition of the romances--one in the 1940s and the one Judy finds herself in--is well balanced and works.

Some elements didn't work so well. I found the depiction of Italians and Italian-Americans to be a bit over-the-top. (I almost expected Chico Marx and Mr. Bacciagalupe to appear.) It was far from offensive, however, because (a) some of the stereotypes are quite true (I can attest to this as an Italian-American), and (b) these characters are generally presented in a good-natured way. My last nitpick has to do with the ending of the legal component of the case which I will not give away here.

4.0,False,"06 13, 2013",A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B000FC14DU,,Rocco Dormarunno,"Early on, in Lisa Scottoline's gripping ""Mistaken Identity"", attorney Bennie Rosato reminds her associates that a defense lawyer doesn't seek justice. Justice is secondary to, if not in conflict with, loyalty to the client. As the novel progresses, however, Bennie finds her own advice hard to swallow because the client, who may or may not be her identical twin that she never knew existed, is a devious and dangerous woman, accused of murdering a policeman. Later in the book, one of Bennie's legal associates, takes boxing lessons. The advice given to her by her trainer is that if you punish the body long enough, the head will fall. This advice goes further than anyone involved in the case would have imagined. Punishing the prosecutor's case, and dogged investigation, would bring justice while maintaining loyalty--to a degree. To me, these were the central points of this tense and intense novel.

Ms. Scottoline does a magnificent juggling act here. Unlike most mysteries or courtroom dramas which focus on a handful of developed characters and bring in dozens of marginally described minor characters, this book is crowded with believable, three dimensional people. Besides the three women in Rosato's firm, there are the defendant and her fellow inmates; there's Rosato's boyfriend, Grady; there's a cabal of individually motivated crooked cops; there's the judge; the D.A.; a hotheaded prizefighter... the list goes on.

Unfortunately, even the most accomplished jugglers will, oops, drop something. In this case, there are some unanswered questions. While mystery/courtroom novels are supposed to dangle red herrings, there were a couple that needed to be explained. Perhaps they will be addressed in later novels.

An old Italian man, ""Pigeon Tony,"" who lived in prewar Italy under Mussolini and the Black Shirts and fled to America with his young son, is now accused of murdering another Italian-American, Angelo Coluzzi. Coluzzi is a rich man who is corrupt and has ties to the Mafia.

During flashbacks in the book, we see why their ages-old feud, since their lives in Italy when Coluzzi was one of the Black Shirts, led to the killing. And, according to Pigeon Tony, that's what it was--killing, not murder.

THE VENDETTA DEFENSE is one book in Scottoline's series about a Philadelphia law firm. One of the associate lawyers in the firm takes on this case, made more difficult by Pigeon Tony's ongoing insistence that he tell the judge that he did, in fact, kill Coluzzi. Pigeon Tony was sure the killing was justified because it wasn't murder; Coluzzi killed Pigeon Tony's wife in Italy many years ago and his son and daughter-in-law more recently in Philadelphia.

I gave this book a chance because I wanted to read a story with Judy Carrier as the main character.  If you've read any of the author's previous works, you know who Judy is.  In this book, we learn a little more--particularly about her work ethic.
Judy seems to work more hours than there are in one day.  She works almost exclusively on this one case and she's not getting paid for it although she racks up some pretty hefty expenses.  There are a lot of loose ends here and a lot of items introduced but, never explained.  For example, there is a character named Murphy in Judy's office mentioned a couple of times as a ""sidebar"" and then the conflict between the two characters is never mentioned again.

In this book, (Ms.) Bennie Rosato herself enjoys the limelight occupied by her associates Mary and Judy from other stories (although they both appear with small parts herein); so it's nice we finally get to learn much more about the principal herself.  Moreover, the author baits our hook in chapter 1 that the murder defendant, Alice Connelly, may be Bennie's unknown identical twin - and appearances at a minimum seem convincing.  We're kept in limbo on this question until chapter 41 (of 44), adding a great deal of suspense to a story otherwise already pretty compelling.  Even the book's title vacillates in our minds as first a clue then a red herring re the twin mystery.  But while we get the twin question settled finally by DNA (one way or the other), unlike so many tales of this genre, several plot elements are left to further pondering at the end.  In fact, that the book ends on a situation hardly totally settled may speak to perhaps the ethical issues the Publisher often asserts is part of Scottoline's appeal.

The premise here is that Tony Lucia (""Pigeon Tony"", from his expertise with homing pigeon racing), on trial for murdering a life-long rival, Angelo Coluzzi, admits to the ""killing"" but not to the ""murder"".  Will the jury buy that fine line -- that somehow this death was justifiable given that Coluzzi killed Pigeon Tony's wife decades ago in Fascist Italy, and killed his son and daughter-in-law in a fake auto accident here in America, where the two families immigrated to none other than Scottoline's latest stomping ground, South Philly.
In the process of unfolding that story line, we get some obviously well researched description of Italy in the Mussolini era, rich with imagery and character development (eventually respun for the jury's benefit as well...).  We get glimpses of life in the Italian ""sector"" of South Philly, using Judy's stream of consciousness to make it fun as opposed to stereotypical, with Pigeon Tony's handsome grandson thrown in to (finally!) give Judy a little welcome sex life, only adding to the character development and good time had by all.  Lastly, Bennie herself adds a little to the courtroom machinations, to liven up a case that looks winnable until Pigeon Tony insists he wants to ""talk to the judge"" (testify).
That's why I like this book a lot -- it's a really good mix of writing ingredients, from a compelling story that you want to come out a certain way, to really good characterizations of people easy to like, with plenty of suspense and humor thrown in to really entertain throughout.  I was also pleased that some of the lapses into very implausible action (lawyers tailing criminal's cars, or fighting against their own clients) that characterized some of the earlier works in this series was finally absent from the book at hand.

Three pages into Lisa Scottoline's sixth novel, Mistaken Identity, I wasn't sure I was going to make it to page ten. Scottoline opens the novel with her protagonist, Bennie Rosato, walking into the county prison where her newest client is in residence, mentally rattling off statistics that we've all heard a million times, most of which are, to say the least, on shaky ground as far as their worth is concerned. It is a horrible opening; thankfully, it is also short. The book improves tremedously on page four, and stays improved for the next five hundred plus pages.

Rosato's newest client is Alice Connolly, who greets her with the rather surprising revelation that Connolly is Rosato's twin, despite that the two have never met before. The twin thing certainly throws a few extra monkeywrenches into the works of the normal courtroom/detective story, not that it needed any. Connolly is accused of killing her live-in boyfriend, a Philadelphia police officer, and makes nasty hints that other cops are framing her. The first half of the book alternates between Rosato trying to figure out if there really is a conspiracy and trying to figure out whether Connolly actually killed her boyfriend, as the two things aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. This section is standard mystery fare; if you're a fan of the genre, it'll work for you.

Where Scottoline shines is once the case gets to court. When you reach page 300 and they're getting ready for trial, you start wondering how Scottoline is going to fill the second half of the book. She does so brilliantly, better even than many nonfiction true crime books cover trials. In fact, the only book I can think of that goes into this much detail of the trial, specifically the dialogue, is Bataille's <i>The Trial of Gilles de Rais</i> (in which the second half of the book is simply unexpurgated trial transcripts). In both Bataille's work of nonfiction and Scottoline's novel, we are given solid evidence that cutting out the supposedly extraneous material of a trial, a rather common method of speeding up books/movies/TV shows, may be good for cutting time, but that all the other stuff is going to be just as gripping to the devoted reader of courtroom-procedure books. Scottoline takes us, line by line, through a cross-examination instead of summarizing. It's wonderful. Would that more courtroom-drama authors did such things. Maybe, as Scottoline gains the audience she deserves, it'll catch on.

5.0,False,"06 18, 2001",A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,B000FC14DU,,Donald Mitchell,"This review is of the unabridged audiocassette version of The Vendetta Defense as performed by Ms. Barbara Rosenblat.
Warm, rich, rewarding, and engaging are all adjectives that jump to mind about this masterly story of the clash of cultures, egos, and generations.  Ms. Scottoline has a rich imagination, love of her characters, and warm feelings for her readers that make this story come alive with passion, tension, and revealing emotions.
The character of Anthony ""Pigeon Tony"" Lucia is one of the most interesting and appealing that I have come across in many years.  He may be the most interesting defendent ever in a fictional case.  Mr. Lucia is essentially a simple man of peace, with a great respect for nature, beauty, and honesty.  Yet his natural goodness has brought him into conflict with the literal forces of darkness in the form of an ex-fascist black shirt, Angelo Coluzzi.  The two men's lives have moved in parallel orbits for over 60 years, and this story recounts how all that occurred and what the implications are for all of us.  Pigeon Tony has always sought to turn the other cheek, and has paid a large price for his acceptance of his tormentor's attentions.  Did he do the right thing?
The Vendetta Defense sets up many interesting conflicts to build on the basic one of good versus evil.  These contrasts include the law versus taking action as ways to solve problems, the perspectives of different generations, the views of the native-born Americans versus immigrants, Italian-Americans versus those of other national backgrounds, and seeking pleasure versus seeking goodness.  The plot is even more complicated than that, including flashbacks over Pigeon Tony's life, a complex set of legal maneuvers, physical and mental battles, and a developing relationship for Ms. Judy Carrier, Pigeon Tony's attorney, and Pigeon Tony's grandson, Frank.
For those who like top-notch legal conflicts in their fiction, you will like the many twists and turns of this case.  It also has a comedic flair to offset the many moments of darkest despair.  You will be reminded of the gravedigger's scene in Hamlet at several points in the book.
Ms. Rosenblat's performance is superb.  She easily makes the transition between male and female voices, people of vastly different ages, alternative accents, and a wide range of emotions.  I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her read this outstanding book.  I strongly urge you to listen to this version of the book.  You will undoubtedly enjoy the book even more than if you simply read it.
After you finish The Vendetta Defense, ask yourself what you would have done at each step in the life of Pigeon Tony.  What did you learn about yourself in the process?

5.0,False,"05 11, 2001",AEJAGHLC675A7,B000FC14DU,,John Williamson,"When someone kills another, is it always murder, and can such killing of another be justified? Lisa Scottoline tackles these moral and legal dilemmas in THE VENDETTA DEFENSE, her newest work. And saying it right up front, this reviewer feels that it's her best work to date.
The very first line of this book states that Tony Lucia killed Angelo Colluzi that morning. Pigeon Tony, as he's known to his friends, is an elderly man who gets his name from the pigeons he loves and races, as he has done all his life. He is arrested for the murder of Colluzi, who it turns out, has had a vendetta going against Pigeon Tony and his family since the days when they both lived in Italy during the Fascist era.
The Philadelphia law firm of Rosato and Associates will be familiar to those who have read Ms. Scottoline's previous novels. Bennie Rosato and Mary DiNunzio make appearances, but in this one Judy Carrier takes the lead role of Pigeon Tony's defense attorney against the wishes of Bennie, who is her boss. And just to further complicate issues, Judy falls in love with Pigeon Tony's grandson, Frank.
A master at characterization, Lisa Scottoline writes about South Philadelphia, its environs and its people as if she's strolled through the streets, examining the cracks on the sidewalks, noting the walls that have peeling paint, remembering which parking meters are not functioning. Her attention to detail comes from one who has experienced the area and its people, not just imagined them. She makes one visualize her characters as real, multi-dimensional people, and not just flat caricatures.
And speaking of descriptions, look out for the details about Judy Carrier's new bright green VW Beetle if you want an example of how the author pays attention to visualizations, right down to the flower in the glass bottle in the console. This is just one small example.
As a mystery writer, Ms. Scottoline has successfully drawn on her experiences as an attorney. She further deals with touchy legal ethical issues in this book, something she has lectured on at law schools before.
As in her previous novels this book is at times movingly sensitive and compassionate. At other times it is humorous, funny in a subtle way, and at other times you'll want to laugh out loud.
I didn't think that a ""vendetta defense"" such as this was a plausible plot when I first read about it. Ms. Scottoline seems to bring her three-dimensional characters to life, and make the concept conceivable.
If you have come to enjoy Lisa Scottoline's writing style, her characterizations and her subtle sense of humor, then this is a book you will find to be amongst her best. And if you haven't read any of her previous works, you may want to pick up a few of them in addition to this one.

I'd compare this one to watching an average movie. Well-written enough, with characters that you do care about, an intriguing murder (and murderer, for that matter). And yet it still fell short of what I expected, especially since I like Scottoline's books and always look forward to reading them. Maybe it was just me but somehow I didn't find the plot, action and characterization as compelling as other books she has written. Pigeon Tony, the elderly man who has murdered a long-hated enemy, is a sweet, lovable guy and you want him to get out of the murder rap (even though he DID murder the guy, which is no secret, that's clear from the start of this book) and his friends are also likeable. But this book dragged for me until the actual trial got going. There's a love angle, there's the murder, there is danger lurking around every corner - but all of these plot angles were not written in an unpredictable or intriquing enough manner for my taste. Having said that, please be aware that this book is far above the average for this genre and you might find you like it well enough. Like I said, my opinion is just that - a very personal one.","Breezy and light, will hold your interest...",987638400,,

""The Vendetta Defense"" is the story of ""Pigeon Tony"" Lucia (he breeds and races pigeons), an elderly Italian gentleman who admits that he has killed his enemy, eighty-year-old Angela Coluzzi, in order to settle an ancient vendetta.  In a series of flashbacks, we learn the story of Tony Lucia and Angelo Coluzzi.  These two men were neighbors in a small town in Italy sixty years ago, and they were rivals for the hand of the beautiful Silvana.  Silvana chose Tony Lucia over Angelo Coluzzi, and Angelo, a rabid Fascist and a vicious thug, never forgave this betrayal.  Coluzzi spent his life doing everything that he could to destroy the Lucia family.  For over half a century, Tony has restrained his anguish, until the fateful day when he and Coluzzi finally have it out.  Judy Carrier, a hotshot lawyer in Bennie Rosato's all-female law firm, decides to take on Tony Lucia's seemingly hopeless case.  While trying this case, Judy risks her life, weathers exciting and nerve-wracking courtroom battles and finds love with Frank, Tony's gorgeous grandson.  Scottoline's novel is at times achingly poignant, especially during the flashbacks, and at other times, it is laugh-out-loud funny.  Scottoline is politically incorrect in her depiction of the old Italian men and young Italian mobsters who live in South Philly.  ""The Vendetta Defense"" works as a light and entertaining mystery, and I recommend it unreservedly.  Fans of Scottoline will fall in love with Judy and Pigeon Tony, and they will enjoy this wonderful novel immensely.","Brava, Scottoline!",984614400,,

The first part is little more than an emotional rant. The communist manifesto is completely untenable and unrealistic in any practical form. This is evinced since the advent of communism in Russia through every country that touts the communist ideal. This utopian idea, as Marx states himself, can only exist at the behest of a bourgeois already in existence and well developed that a proletariat might be created so that the communist philosophy may become necessary and thereby implemented. The society Marx outlines is devoid of any boundaries, towns, cities, provinces, states, counties, countries, and political parties. From its thrust into the world in Russia throughout every communist country currently in existence, not a single one of them reflects the philosophy and ideology of Marx's communism. All communist regimes are just as much a prime example of class distinction and class antagonism, albeit minus the ""right"" to publicly take any position not in line with the ruling communist class. Marx's philosophy directly opposes not only industrialization but also the advent and continued proliferation of a mechanized world. It is also a philosophy lacking any sense of values and character indemnified by Marx's open declaration that communists will ride on the back of any revolutionary movement they view as having the probability of overthrowing the ruling class of any nation regardless of that revolutionary movement's philosophy.

After reading this the naivety of Marx and his fellow communists of his era, the progenitors of the communist philosophy, it becomes abundantly obvious that power hungry, greedy men of unbounded avarice would see the communist philosophy as a means to their ends with the window of opportunity presently afforded them at the time. These men then used the guise of communist utopia to rally men to their cause, the poorer the better, to agitate them towards violence and ride the wave of revolution to victory and the establishment of yet another government that does not also create class distinction and oppression but brutally does so. Once these men are in power the result is similar to a monarchy without the opulence. Not only all power is invested in the ruling class but also so is all the national wealth held by the ruling class, just like it is in a monarchy.
Boundaries are not erased in any sense but are more firmly established and enforced even at the cost of death for anyone who would try to escape such a blissful existence.

The representative government authorized by a constitution is not, as no construct of men may not be, without its problems. Still, a government defined by the people of a nation, restricted by a constitution, and built upon inherent rights belonging to every human being, is far better than anything else the world had in the past or currently exercises.",A Utopian Manifesto,1512000000,,

Ive been hearing about The Communist Manifesto"" since middle school, so I finally decided to pick up a copy [on iBooks - its in open domain] and checked it out.

Its a short piece [52 pages], divided into four sections.

The first section was awesome. Its about the relationship between the working and the ruling class, and why it is as it is. It talks about such things as the dissolution of social capital into financial capital [such as in the destruction of the family for industrial means] [p7]. It talks about the fragility of the industrial economy [p8], the profit/debt cycles that drive that economy forward [p9], and globalization [p9]. It even talks about how financial capital has become a form of artificial intelligence [p12]. The inverse relationship between the repulsiveness of a job and its pay is also investigated [p13]. It talks about the homogenization of culture [p18], and the 99% [p18]. In short, its brilliant.

After that though, the piece goes down hill. The second section outlines communism, which doesnt seem to address any of the problems outlined in the first section, except for property [p26]. Instead, it looks into centralization, something Im not a fan of. And then the third section didn't really make sense to me, because it heavily referenced current [mid 1800s] political conditions. The fourth section is simply a final call to action.

Im not exactly sure why Marx understood the situation so well [his analysis is still dead on today], yet couldn't approach meaningful application. Id still recommend giving his work a read though.",Too Much About Centralization,1483488000,,

3.0,True,"11 28, 2015",A1BKWL9QFKB2EX,B000FC27TA,,Walter Stanley,"Having read a number of philosophers over the decades, I have come to the conclusion that most of them are crackpots.  Especially those devoted to developing political and economic Utopias and who advocate violence to achieve them.  Karl Marx advocated the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie to implement his classless Utopia.  So one can see why Communism was  is -- so feared by wealthy Capitalists.  Inadvertently, Communism has been Capitalisms greatest ally, since it has been so blatantly demented it makes Capitalism look good in comparison.  Communism became not just a struggle with those who had unjustly appropriated the lions share, and then some, of the national wealth, it degenerated into a war against the middle class.  Which, in fact, was what the crackpot wanted.  It made it possible to equate Communism with labor unions, Socialism, and even with people fighting Colonialism for national independence.  While Capitalism depends upon exploitation of weaker people, those countries the Capitalists were exploiting understandably wanted their wealth for their own people.  As Marx asks near the beginning of the Manifesto:  Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power?  USAmerica advocated the violent overthrow of the democratically-elected leaders of such regimes, Vietnam, Chile, and Iran being salient examples, in the name of fighting godless Communism.  While apologists for Communism claim, correctly enough, that Russia and China were rather the opposite of what Marx had in mind, when hatred and violence are promoted, that is what should be expected.  One could likewise insist, correctly, that the Inquisition and the genocide of Native Americans were the opposite of what Christ had in mind.  On the other hand, they were very much what Moses and Joshua had in mind.  But thats just my pet peeve.

Some of the knee-jerk Capitalist reviewers complain about all of the things Marx and Engels got wrong, usually without making specifications.  One, who wrote a very long, specific review started out by saying that Marx was made immediately obsolete because there was a wage increase in 1848.  Wow!  So the novels of John Steinbeck were based upon nothing?  The recent slaughter of garment workers in Cambodia who were striking for a living wage did not happen?  It is worth pointing out at least a few of the things that Marx got right.

[Capitalism] has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  Free trade.  This is something that many Capitalisms victims (the ones who were not murdered) in Chile complain about.  For an obvious example right at home, look at the fast-food industry.  Rather than taking pride in nourishing Americas youth, they take pride in getting enormously wealthy by feeding children cheap, habit-forming junk that has made obesity one of the number one health problems in America.  And cigarette manufacturers not only fought tooth-and-nail denying that cigarettes caused cancer, even though they knew better, they added ingredients to them that made them more addictive.  I actually once defended American cigarette companies because I could not believe that they had done that.  But they did.

The need of a constantly expanding markets for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe.  It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.  Now we might add that it does this in order to find cheap labor.  Cheap labor in right wing countries (purportedly Communist countries) in which common laborers are disenfranchised from a voice in government and their complaints are violently suppressed.

There are other examples of things Marx got right, but it is pertinent to now look at a few things the crackpot Capitalist lovers-of-wisdeom got wrong.  We can start with Adam Smith, as THE WEALTH OF NATIONS is more-or-less the Bible of Laissez-Faire Capitalism.  In Smiths time it was taken for granted, as it is now in many Capitalist nations, that workers deserved no more than bare-subsistence wages.  This meant that the health conditions of the poor were such that about 50% of their children died, so they had to be paid at least this much to insure a continuing supply of workers.  To be sure, medicine was so primitive in those days that even the children of the middle class and wealthy died in alarming numbers, but it was clearly much worse for the poor.  One could even reasonably argue that the wealthier people might have been healthier if the poor had been better maintained.  At any rate, having a large population of extremely impoverished people provides fertile ground for crackpot Communism.  (At the present time, over 50% pf the worlds population lives on less than $2.00/day, and the population will double in about 40 years.  But there is no reason for crackpot Capitalists to be nervous).  Smith is famous for his invisible hand conjecture.  It is not a theory; lets use correct terminology here.  This sounds a lot like mysticism, or wishful thinking, and history has repeatedly demonstrated that it is just that.  Admittedly, that assessment differs from that of the few people who have become extraordinarily wealthy as a consequence of it, but that isn't that many people.

John Locke preceded Smith as Capitalist apologist, in the days when mercantilism was morphing into capitalism.  His great contribution was to argue that even though in the olden days no one had any right to acquire excess land because the goods produced on that land would spoil, the advent of money made it morally right for one person to acquire all the land that he could.  He then argued that money had been implicit in human nature from the very beginning, and therefore Capitalism was harmonious with human nature.  Property is everyones God-given right, but the only property landless people have is their own labor.  When they sell this labor to support themselves, they are no longer independent.  Only independent people are capable of rationality, and only rational people are capable of participating in government.  Ergo, workers are incapable of rationality and have no right to participate in government.  This reasoning is so blatantly spurious it should not require refutation.  Nor would refutation even be possible for anyone unreasonable enough to believe it.
Ayn Rand is The Goddess of the Market, as Jennifer Burns refers to her in her excellent biography.  Alan Greenspan was her disciple, who was once, before the crash, touted as the rock star of economics.  Despite the fact that her novels depict people no more believable than those found in a Doc Savage thriller, and contain rambling, lengthy soliloquies impenetrably dull and replete with spurious logic that only the blindly faithful can wade through, she is considered by her devotees, as one of the outstanding writers of the 20th Century.  She calls her philosophy objectivism, even though it is obviously unmitigated subjectivism.  Selfishness is a virtue, although she pretends that selfishness has a different meaning than it actually has.  Looking out for ones own interest will naturally lead to what is best for everybody, so that is the ultimate morality.  Fair wages, she maintains, are determined by the market, so striking for living wages can only be detrimental, even for the people doing the striking.  Paying $36,000 for a wrist watch in a country where workers make $100/month (about 0.60/hour) is a distribution of wealth fairly determined by the market place.  It goes without saying that she is opposed to health care, and also to public education.  Ignorant people are more easily manipulated.  Though Rand and her ilk talk constantly of freedom, it is the freedom of the market they want, not of people.  When Rand praises America as the first moral nation, it is not because of its democracy, a word she never uses.  Largely thanks to her efforts, American has been devoured by the wealthy.

Since 1999, after the economic meltdown, the suicide rate for older white men has risen from 20,000 per year to about 30,000 per year in 2013.  Despite this, successful Capitalists typically insist that Capitalism is the economic system most in harmony with human nature.  From this one must conclude that they believe that suicidal despair is in harmony with human nature.  Moreover, it is also human nature to be easily manipulated.  Capitalism heavily relies upon this human trait, though not more so than feudalism, mercantilism, Christianity and all other religions, Nazism, Communism, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, the Crips and the Bloods, etc.  However, there are those of us who believe that this all-too-human trait of being easily manipulated is merely what we are taught.  Since the people in power always rely upon an easily manipulated populace, this is what people have always been taught.  But a populace of easily-manipulated people can easily be manipulated against those in power by ruthless men with their own agenda, so a society of people easily swayed by passionate pseudo-reasoning can never be stable.  A genuine education should be geared toward teaching people not to be easily manipulated.  There is no reason why this should not be possible.  Since civilization has been around for 10,000 years or so, it would be a good idea to finally get around to giving it a try.  Ill bet that Christ would approve.

Yes, Marx was wrong in many ways, but that does not mean that Capitalism is right.  The difference between Communism and Socialism, I never tire of pointing out, is that Communism believe that a violent revolution will be necessary to achieve a more equitable distribution of national wealth; Socialists believe that a more equitable distribution of national wealth must be achieved to prevent that from happening.","A sociopathic crackpot, but merely one of many",1448668800,,

After the time of the Renaissance and glorious revolution of France, when the peasants rose up in revolt because of hunger, due to national debt that the king and the government couldn't get it together and finally lost his head over it.  The Public Safety Committee takes off his head, Robespierre takes over and begin beheading everyone that disagreed with them to the point that poetic justice took off his head after he beheaded  approximately 20,000 heads a year during his reign of terror.  A lot like the Bolshevik revolution when Lenin came back from Switzerland, killed Nicholas II and his whole family, including the children, furthering more killings of innocent peasants as the Tsar had before he executed him and his family.  Like France which started a revolution for more democracy and received another dictator in Robespierre and  Napoleon Bonaparte.

Karl Marx writes like the philosophers before the Renaissance, like them, he rambles on with rhetoric that rambles on with bad writing grammar  over explaining his theories.  His rambling rhetoric literary technique in prose would drive a maggot crazy, but is worth the education to plow through it.  His philosophy is full of take from the rich and give to the poor.  If Marxism isn't the answer what is, because some of the principles are good, free college education for our children and let capitalism work with less and our nation wouldn't fall behind the rest of the world as illiterate.  We ask why our children don't go to college, because after they get good paying jobs they spend twenty years paying off student loans, we discourage our children from going to college.  In this Karl Marx is right, the rich can afford to send their kids to college but the poor can't, keeping their descendants poor too, and crippling  the enhancement of the skills of our nations.

It should be stressed for the novice to this subject, all three volumes of Capital provide a scientific explanation, as Marx put it, of how the Capitalist system works from the perspective that labor is the underlying essence of all value. If one accepts the basic assumptions made early in Chapter 1 of Capital, Volume 1--that abstract labor is the source of value(1)--Marx's logic flows well, not only through Volume 1, but all the way through Volume 3.

If one is looking to fault Marx's economics based on the works of Capital, one will come up empty not only because Marx's logic is flawless, but as economist and former Marxist Thomas Sowell says, "" ...Marx considered the idea of proving a concept to be ridiculous. Moreover, Engels had asserted...that one only proves one's ignorance of dialectics by thinking of it as a means by which things can be proved.""(2)

However, there was one instance where Marx let his dialectical guard down, allowing for an empirical objection that would consign all of Marx's works for naught. Sowell himself touches upon the specific passage where Marx cornered himself, but doesn't appreciate the full ramifications of Marx's observation.

In the ""The Poverty of Philosophy"" (1847) Marx says, ""In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The handmill [a productive force] gives you society with the feudal lord, the steam-mill [a productive force], society with the industrial capitalist.""(3)

Sowell argues regarding Marx's handmill/steam-mill analogy, ""If read literally, these words suggest a one-way causation and explanation of given states of being rather than of transformation. But that is clearly inconsistent both with Marx's and Engels' own treatment of history and with the dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction. These words are perhaps best read as epigrams-and of the dangers of misunderstanding inherent in that writing style.""(4)

Is Sowell correct? Was Marx merely being terse with his handmill/steam-mill analogy?

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a ""dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction"", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor,(5) Marx writes:

""Thus it is slapping history in the face to want to begin by the division of labor in general, in order to get subsequently to a specific instrument of production, machinery.

Machinery is no more an economic category than the bullock that drags the plough. Machinery is merely a productive force. The modern workshop, which depends on the application of machinery, is a social production relation, an economic category.""(6)

The problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material ""productive forces"" empirical observation.

Simplified, Marx is speaking of the root cause for industrial Capitalism...the steam engine, but that beginning of industrial Capitalism only exists to the extent of (1) the already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactured the component parts for the steam engine; (2) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the constituent parts that went into the construction of the steam engine; (3) the already existing industrial Capitalist capital goods/intermediate goods industries that manufactured the machines that the steam engine powers; and (4) an already existing industrial Capitalist division of labor that manufactures those machines powered by the steam engine!

When the first steam-mill was completed supposedly, according to Marx, 'giving' a society with industrial Capitalism, in fact industrial Capitalism, and an industrial Capitalist division of labor, already existed, and would have to already be in existence otherwise there could be no steam-mills and the machines they were created to power!

Marx behaves like a child throwing a tantrum: Machines come first, then all else follows. Why? Because Marx said so, even though the historical record says otherwise!

In fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism couldn't have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based, interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.

During the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.

We therefore see that not only was it necessary to already have an existing industrial Capitalist division of labor before machines made their appearance, there also needed to be in existence the requisite financing for the new machines to come into existence, meaning a new industrial Capitalist financial setup (where market-based, higher, interest rates are the norm) was a necessary precursor for the emergence of industrial Capitalism.

Revised Addendum: Formulated on February 25, 2014, 10:30 AM EST

Proof that Marx's Law of Value (which posits that labor is the sole source of value, imputing that value into commodities) is in error:

If all the machines created throughout the history of man were to have been kept within the confines of the minds of their creators, that is never manufactured, would such machines be imputed with value in a Marxist sense? Yes, they should equal the POTENTIAL value of their labor.

Now, since actual labor is required for there to be potential value, and there is no actual labor to speak of, then the potential imputation of labor value into machines/commodities is zero, and therefore Marx's Law of Value is in error.

In fact, the proof affirms that imputation of a commodity's value can't be anything physical, it must be subjective...that is in the mind of the observer.

Addendum (July 18, 2014):

The following nicely illustrates how net (new) investment (productivity increases) took place before medium of exchange, while (1) also illustrating how such net (new) investments spurred trade between separated communities; and (2) clarifying Marx's confusion as to what came first to alter social relations, (i) machines; or (ii) something else preceding machines...

Tribe A saved more by looking for food less, placing that saved time into creating a net that would increase the catch of fish. We can say that Tribe A has a greater productive edge than does Tribe B, whose members are still using sharpened sticks to catch fish--very laborious and relatively unproductive.

Now Tribe A decides, due to its higher productivity/wealth, it can afford to save more time, adding this saved time to the saved time it used for making fishing nets, and build a boat that will allow their nets to catch even more fish. Being busy building boats, Tribe A allows Tribe B to build the nets--a less productive venture than the new boat-building venture is. Tribe A's greater productivity thanks to fishing boats (and greater wealth thanks to fishing boats) allows for more children, increasing the tribe's population, allowing for a larger labor supply in the near future that will be available for procuring other innovative, labor-saving inventions.

In the modern economy the money we save is the ""saved time"" that Tribe A used to construct nets/boats, but since the rate of interest is being intentionally kept low by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, there can be no new capital formation (money that's used for new long-term productive investments) in Western economies (nor Japan) for new productive ventures, because the lure for such new investments--the higher rate of return that higher, market-based, interest rates offer--is non-existent; the central bank mandated low interest rate policy won't cover the loan on the massive outlay of capital that net (new) productive projects require.

By the way, notice what comes first in the above illustration, contradicting Marx's claim that the ""material productive forces"" (machines) are the INITIAL venue by which societies alter their values/relationships...people had to ""save time"" FIRST by curtailing their quest for food.* Now in the modern economy, where money is used, FIRST comes the necessity of market-based interest rates that allows for the accumulation of capital that THEN produces the labor-saving machines! The higher the market-based interest rate, the better for capital accumulation.

In the ""The Poverty of Philosophy"" (1847) Marx says, ""In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their living, they change all their social relations. The handmill [a productive force] gives you society with the feudal lord, the steam-mill [a productive force], society with the industrial capitalist.""(3)

Sowell argues regarding Marx's handmill/steam-mill analogy, ""If read literally, these words suggest a one-way causation and explanation of given states of being rather than of transformation. But that is clearly inconsistent both with Marx's and Engels' own treatment of history and with the dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction. These words are perhaps best read as epigrams-and of the dangers of misunderstanding inherent in that writing style.""(4)

Is Sowell correct? Was Marx merely being terse with his handmill/steam-mill analogy?

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a ""dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction"", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor, Marx writes:

""Thus it is slapping history in the face to want to begin by the division of labor in general, in order to get subsequently to a specific instrument of production, machinery.

Machinery is no more an economic category than the bullock that drags the plough. Machinery is merely a productive force. The modern workshop, which depends on the application of machinery, is a social production relation, an economic category.""(5)

The problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material ""productive forces"" empirical observation.

Simplified, Marx is speaking of the root cause for industrial Capitalism...the steam mill, but that beginning of industrial Capitalism only exists to the extent of (1) the division of labor that manufactured the component parts going into the steam-mill; and (2) the capital/producer goods industries that manufactured the constituent parts that went into the construction of the steam-mill.

When the first steam-mill was completed supposedly, according to Marx, 'giving' a society with industrial Capitalism, in fact there could be no 'giving' of such a society since the steam-mill when completed wasn't in operation. In fact, that which actually 'gave' a society with industrial Capitalism were those factors of production that produced the steam-mill!

Marx behaves like a child throwing a tantrum: Machines come first, then all else follows. Why? Because Marx said so, even though the historical record says otherwise!

In fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism could not have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.

During the Mercantilist era low interest rates ensured that only consumption-based investments could take place, such investments requiring relatively little capital expenditures, such low capital expenditures being a function of the expected return on the investment, which return is based on the low interest rate policy being followed by Mercantilist nations. Industrial ventures, on the other hand, require large expenditures of capital, such amounts only made possible by a higher rate of return that can recoup the larger capital outlay, a higher rate of return that is made possible only with higher, market-based, interest rates.

Anyone after 1847 could have demolished Marx's materialist philosophy (which is where ""productive forces"" comes from) by noting the above objections to Marx's handmill/steam mill observation, thereby sparing us three volumes of Capital. In fact, someone did just that...Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Marxists (or whoever ""Marxists"" really are) pretend Proudhon didn't demolish Marx.

Revised Addendum: Formulated on February 25, 2014, 10:30 AM EST

Proof that Marx's Law of Value (which posits that labor is the sole source of value, imputing that value into commodities) is in error:

If all the machines created throughout the history of man were to have been kept within the confines of the minds of their creators, that is never manufactured, would such machines be imputed with value in a Marxist sense? Yes, they should equal the POTENTIAL value of their labor.

Now, since actual labor is required for there to be potential value, and there is no actual labor to speak of, then the potential imputation of labor value into machines/commodities is zero, and therefore Marx's Law of Value is in error.

In fact, the proof affirms that imputation of a commodity's value can't be anything physical, it must be subjective...that is in the mind of the observer.
--------------------------------------
Addendum (July 18, 2014):

The following nicely illustrates how net (new) investment (productivity increases) took place before medium of exchange, while (1) also illustrating how such net (new) investments spurred trade between separated communities; and (2) clarifying Marx's confusion as to what came first to alter social relations, (i) machines; or (ii) something else preceding machines...

Tribe A saved more by looking for food less, placing that saved time into creating a net that would increase the catch of fish. We can say that Tribe A has a greater productive edge than does Tribe B, whose members are still using sharpened sticks to catch fish--very laborious and relatively unproductive.

Now Tribe A decides, due to its higher productivity/wealth, it can afford to save more time, adding this saved time to the saved time it used for making fishing nets, and build a boat that will allow their nets to catch even more fish. Being busy building boats, Tribe A allows Tribe B to build the nets--a less productive venture than the new boat-building venture is. Tribe A's greater productivity thanks to fishing boats (and greater wealth thanks to fishing boats) allows for more children, increasing the tribe's population, allowing for a larger labor supply in the near future that will be available for procuring other innovative, labor-saving inventions.

In the modern economy the money we save is the ""saved time"" that Tribe A used to construct nets/boats, but since the rate of interest is being intentionally kept low by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, there can be no new capital formation (money that's used for new long-term productive investments) in Western economies (nor Japan) for new productive ventures, because the lure for such new investments--the higher rate of return that higher, market-based, interest rates offer--is non-existent; the central bank mandated low interest rate policy won't cover the loan on the massive outlay of capital that net (new) productive projects require.

By the way, notice what comes first in the above illustration, contradicting Marx's claim that the ""material productive forces"" (machines) are the INITIAL venue by which societies alter their values/relationships...people had to ""save time"" FIRST by curtailing their quest for food.* Now in the modern economy, where money is used, FIRST comes the necessity of market-based interest rates that allows for the accumulation of capital that THEN produces the labor-saving machines! The higher the market-based interest rate, the better for capital accumulation.

4.0,True,"03 4, 2012",A3DF1AUW7I7W95,B000FC2S2Q,,Elliot,"Harry Bates was the first editor of Astounding Stories, from 1930-1933, when the magazine published unsophisticated space opera. As editor, Bates published some of his own stories, using the pen name Anthony Gilmore, but Gilmore's stories, most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hawk-Carse/dp/B004TRN8IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hawk Carse</a>, were as unsophisticated as the rest of what he published.

Under Bates's successors as editors of Astounding, Orville Tremaine (1933-1937) and, especially, John Campbell (1937-1971), science fiction became much more sophisticated and idea-oriented, and, after Bates stopped editing Astounding, his own writing matured along with the field. This anthology collects two stories Bates wrote for Tremaine, ""A Matter of Size"" (1934) and ""Alas, All Thinking"" (1935), and one he wrote for Campbell, ""Farewell to the Master"" (1940).

The blurb for this book describes all three stories as ""novellas,"" but only ""A Matter of Size"" is that long; the other two are novelettes. The Kindle edition has a few typos, nothing too annoying, but has no linked table of contents and prints the stories in reverse chronological order.

""A Matter of Size"" still has elements of early 1930s space adventure, but is more intelligently written than Bates's earlier Gilmore stories. In part of the story, the hero is shrunk by malign aliens to a height of six inches, and some of the perils he faces (including a suddenly-deadly housecat) prefigure the adventures of the hero of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shrinking-Man-RosettaBooks-into-Film/dp/B00514HEHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shrinking Man (RosettaBooks into Film)</a>.

""Alas, All Thinking"" moves closer to the Golden Age style of SF; it is a story of ideas, not action, and the idea was an unusually pessimistic one for 1930s SF: a time-traveller visits the future and discovers that humanity has not progressed, but rather degenerated into helpless, huge-brained beings who do nothing but meditate on ideas that prove to be useless.

""Farewell to the Master"" is a good example of Golden Age SF, balancing ideas and action. The story was the basis for the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" but the movie took only a few incidents from the story. Bates's novelette does not have the anti-war message of the movie, but it has a nice twist ending that the movie did not use.

These three stories are good reading in their own right, if a bit dated by modern standards, and are also interesting illustrations of the way the SF field progressed in the 1930s.",Transitional SF,1330819200,5,

Farewell to the Master -  Forget what you saw in the movie, as the original story is so far and away different than what was brought to life on the silver screen; and, to be quite honest, so much better. As many have noted, the parting lines of this book will take you by complete surprise; and in reading this well executed novella, the reader will be rewarded with a well-crafted, thought-provoking story.

Alas, All Thinking - The tale of a time traveler that encounters the future of the human race...again, with an ending that will leave the reader surprised.

A Matter of Size - In a futuristic era when all corners of space have been explored, a stranger from an unknown race of aliens appears in the laboratory of a scientist on earth with the intent of taking our protagonist to this strangers far-away world to help with an issue only this scientist can help with. What follows is an adventure that can be nest explained as one part HG Wells and one part Edgar Rice Burroughs.

This is a great collection for those who enjoy older sci-fi, great story telling, and still possess a sense of wonder and imagination.

The reader is taken through the history of origination of Communism with emphasis on the need to stabilize the living standards of the people of the world under one common principle of equality.
Some basic principles of Communism like abolition of private property acquiring rights, abolition of inheritance rights and nationalization of production are worth noting down. The emergence of the powerful Bourgeois (middle class) from the feudal lordship and its dominance over a period of time leading to subjugation of the Proletarian (working class) has given a new meaning to Communist ideology.
The major aim of Communism is to raise the Proletarian to the stage of political ruling class thus overthrowing the Bourgeois supremacy. The Communists therefore support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things in the Bourgeois society.
The reader might not understand many terms used by the authors unless and until he has an idea about the economic scenario of his country. Quite complex at times and the ideology goes above the heads of many until read more than once.

""The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed.""

The Communist Manifesto covers a very large amount of information in a very short amount of time. This inevitably means that the statements made are not fully supported, but this is not the point of a manifesto, the purpose of which is to powerfully and coherently state a set of goals for a particular party.

I think the first part of the manifesto was the most interesting. In it a unique (but brief) evaluation of history is given, with Marx's famous ""class struggle"" statement. It is concluded that all antagonisms and conflicts in history have their root in class warfare (nobleman and serf, freeman and slave, etc.) Up until Marx's time, each epoch in history had many different classes, and each time a lower classes would rebel against the upper class minority, the only thing accomplished would be a reconstructed class system with the same root problem. Marx says that in the 19th century, we have the opportunity to completely do away with the class system altogether due to the fact that this is the only time in history where the classes are so distinct: the proletariat (working class majority) and the bourgeoisie (minority that controls most of the capital due to the labor of the working class). Marx says that if the proletariat is able to overthrow the corrupt and exploitative bourgeoisie, unlike all earlier revolutions, there will be a complete transformation in society rather than simply a new reorganization due to the fact that there will be only one class - the proletariat. This means the problem of class antagonism that has so bloodied history would be over.

After explaining how history has progressed and contrasting earlier epochs with the 19th century, the manifesto goes into a compelling critique of capitalist society. Essentially it is said that capitalism has reduced all that is good and noble in the world to the mere accumulation of profit. People are no longer seen as people; they are simply machines to increase labor and thus increase capital. A person's worth is only measured by how much capital he can produce for the ruling bourgeoisie. This is an extremely convincing anti capitalist argument, but it doesn't quite hold up to modern standards. In our time, the proletariat is not exploited anywhere near as horribly as they were in Marx's time. We now have worker unions, worker's rights, shorter workdays, labor limits, laws preventing child labor, safety regulations, higher minimum wage, etc. This was apparently not the case in 1847. One of Marx's biggest problems with capitalism was that only a small minority of bourgeoisie controlled all of the property, while the vast majority proletariat had nothing even though they do all the work. This is not the case today, where most people in industrialized societies have plenty of property for themselves. To me, this is the major reason why The Communist Manifesto does not hold up to modern times (but it couldn't be expected to).

The next part (chapter II) of the manifesto is Marx's illustration of an economic system where all are equals and no one's labor is exploited for the profits of others - communism. I do not have the requisite understanding of economics to say how viable or nonviable communism is compared with capitalism or socialism. I will say that Marx does make communism sound quite appealing. As said earlier, there are no classes in communism so everyone is equal. Labor is not performed simply for profit of a few but for the benefit of all. There is no government controlling what is done in society; the people rule themselves and perform based on the needs of all. The main argument I hear against this system is that with no private property to obtain, there is no incentive to work. Marx counters this by saying the proletariat never had any property to begin with and yet they still worked. Communism is a very utopian idea where everyone works together for the equal good of everyone, no one benefiting more than any other. I don't know how viable this can possibly be seeing as how history has given us no example where someone does not try to take power in order to exploit the weak. In fact, this is exactly what we've seen with the regimes in the 20th century that tried to implement a communist economy - far from a society with no ruling class, they become totalitarian regimes with only a few controlling all the property - exactly what Marx criticised about capitalism. Again, I will leave it to the economists to discuss the most viable economic systems.

Next (chapter III) comes Marx's brief outline and critique of other socialist literature. I did not take away much from this section as it seems that Marx took it as a given that his readers would already be familiar with these various positions, and went straight into the critique without actually explaining what it was he was critiquing. You can somewhat figure out the positions simply based on the critique, but, as mentioned, the critiques are brief and I was still left somewhat lost. A comparison would be reading 19th century critiques of opposing theories to biological evolution without ever having heard of these opposing theories due to evolution being the only accepted theory in our time. This is not so much a knock on the manifesto, since Marx was clearly writing for his contemporaries, but even so things like this throughout the book take away some enjoyment and add confusion.

Chapter IV, the last chapter, is a very short annunciation of the relationship of communism to other movements in various countries, ending with a vigorating call to arms for the working class.

I give the manifesto three stars for two reasons: one being that, as mentioned before, many of the critiques of capitalism do not hold much weight 150+ years later, reducing the manifesto's economic value to merely that of historical significance. The second reason being that even the historical significance will be reduced if the reader does not have at least moderate knowledge of European history, particularly that of the 17th and 18th centuries. In fact, the first time I read the manifesto I wasn't able to take much of anything away from it. I read it a second time after I took four college economics classes and a few history classes and was able to comprehend about 80% of it. Despite these complaints, it is still highly recommended.

""All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind.""",Highly Recommend,1395360000,,

The next part (chapter II) of the manifesto is Marx's illustration of an economic system where all are equals and no one's labor is exploited for the profits of others - communism. I do not have the requisite understanding of economics to say how viable or nonviable communism is compared with capitalism or socialism. I will say that Marx does make communism sound quite appealing. As said earlier, there are no classes in communism so everyone is equal. Labor is not performed simply for profit of a few but for the benefit of all. There is no government controlling what is done in society; the people rule themselves and perform based on the needs of all. The main argument I hear against this system is that with no private property to obtain, there is no incentive to work. Marx counters this by saying the proletariat never had any property to begin with and yet they still worked. Communism is a very utopian idea where everyone works together for the equal good of everyone, no one benefiting more than any other. I don't know how viable this can possibly be seeing as how history has given us no example where someone does not try to take power in order to exploit the weak. In fact, this is exactly what we've seen with the regimes in the 20th century that tried to implement a communist economy - far from a society with no ruling class, they become totalitarian regimes with only a few controlling all the property - exactly what Marx criticised about capitalism. Again, I will leave it to the economists to discuss the most viable economic systems.

Next (chapter III) comes Marx's brief outline and critique of other socialist literature. I did not take away much from this section as it seems that Marx took it as a given that his readers would already be familiar with these various positions, and went straight into the critique without actually explaining what it was he was critiquing. You can somewhat figure out the positions simply based on the critique, but, as mentioned, the critiques are brief and I was still left somewhat lost. A comparison would be reading 19th century critiques of opposing theories to biological evolution without ever having heard of these opposing theories due to evolution being the only accepted theory in our time. This is not so much a knock on the manifesto, since Marx was clearly writing for his contemporaries, but even so things like this throughout the book take away some enjoyment and add confusion.

Chapter IV, the last chapter, is a very short annunciation of the relationship of communism to other movements in various countries, ending with a vigorating call to arms for the working class.

I give the manifesto three stars for two reasons: one being that, as mentioned before, many of the critiques of capitalism do not hold much weight 150+ years later, reducing the manifesto's economic value to merely that of historical significance. The second reason being that even the historical significance will be reduced if the reader does not have at least moderate knowledge of European history, particularly that of the 17th and 18th centuries. In fact, the first time I read the manifesto I wasn't able to take much of anything away from it. I read it a second time after I took four college economics classes and a few history classes and was able to comprehend about 80% of it. Despite these complaints, it is still highly recommended.

""The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed.""

The Communist Manifesto covers a very large amount of information in a very short amount of time. This inevitably means that the statements made are not fully supported, but this is not the point of a manifesto, the purpose of which is to powerfully and coherently state a set of goals for a particular party.

I think the first part of the manifesto was the most interesting. In it a unique (but brief) evaluation of history is given, with Marx's famous ""class struggle"" statement. It is concluded that all antagonisms and conflicts in history have their root in class warfare (nobleman and serf, freeman and slave, etc.) Up until Marx's time, each epoch in history had many different classes, and each time a lower classes would rebel against the upper class minority, the only thing accomplished would be a reconstructed class system with the same root problem. Marx says that in the 19th century, we have the opportunity to completely do away with the class system altogether due to the fact that this is the only time in history where the classes are so distinct: the proletariat (working class majority) and the bourgeoisie (minority that controls most of the capital due to the labor of the working class). Marx says that if the proletariat is able to overthrow the corrupt and exploitative bourgeoisie, unlike all earlier revolutions, there will be a complete transformation in society rather than simply a new reorganization due to the fact that there will be only one class - the proletariat. This means the problem of class antagonism that has so bloodied history would be over.

After explaining how history has progressed and contrasting earlier epochs with the 19th century, the manifesto goes into a compelling critique of capitalist society. Essentially it is said that capitalism has reduced all that is good and noble in the world to the mere accumulation of profit. People are no longer seen as people; they are simply machines to increase labor and thus increase capital. A person's worth is only measured by how much capital he can produce for the ruling bourgeoisie. This is an extremely convincing anti capitalist argument, but it doesn't quite hold up to modern standards. In our time, the proletariat is not exploited anywhere near as horribly as they were in Marx's time. We now have worker unions, worker's rights, shorter workdays, labor limits, laws preventing child labor, safety regulations, higher minimum wage, etc. This was apparently not the case in 1847. One of Marx's biggest problems with capitalism was that only a small minority of bourgeoisie controlled all of the property, while the vast majority proletariat had nothing even though they do all the work. This is not the case today, where most people in industrialized societies have plenty of property for themselves. To me, this is the major reason why The Communist Manifesto does not hold up to modern times (but it couldn't be expected to).

The next part (chapter II) of the manifesto is Marx's illustration of an economic system where all are equals and no one's labor is exploited for the profits of others - communism.

1.0,False,"02 12, 2012",A3I8FT707XKQAJ,B000FC27TA,,Sam Quixote,"Marx and Engels take the position that globalisation is bad and that the spread of trade and free exchange of ideas is bad as it means people aren't satisfied with the old way of doing things after they are exposed to new ways. They don't like technology, adopting the luddite position that it makes everything worse. They believe technology makes workers redundant and take less joy in their work. Before I go any further, does anyone agree with this nonsense? It's like they want to freeze time indefinitely, they're so anti-progress! So far, so dumb.

Their anti-machine spiel continues as they fume that the bourgeois are in control of the machines and therefore the direction the world is taking. They want the working class to control this instead. So it's just one group of society jealous of what another group of society have. Nothing revolutionary here.

I had to include this quote from the manifesto as I found it ironic - ""He (the working man) becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him."" Ironic as they claim this is the state of the working man under bourgeois rule but this is ultimately what would happen to countless millions under communist rule in the 20th century.

The manifesto contains largely sweeping statements that aren't backed up with examples or facts, and bizarre statements about the communist utopia that go along the lines of ""if everyone were communist then there would be no competition and nobody would be better and so there would be no war"". There's a lot of this ""anti-competition"" sentiment in the manifesto as apparently we should all be equal and competition means some would be better than others. And all the even weirder stuff about all private property is abolished - those so-called reasons behind that argument make no sense at all.

I think besides the idealistic posturing, behind which there are no practicalities for how to bring about their ""utopia"". I mean who is to oversee that everyone does a certain job or where all products of production are directed, etc. etc.? There is very little of substance here. But then it's aimed at the 19th century working classes who, especially at this time, were very poorly educated, if at all, and so they wouldn't have the critical thinking to dissect the propaganda and lack of pragmatism that the manifesto contains, they would simply swallow the message of ""bourgeois bad, working class good, we will make the working class have better living standards"". Like a politician, all style, no substance.

And ultimately the manifesto was used as a tool for a whole new group of people to enslave the same people while taking the wealth for themselves. Look at the legacy that the 20th century left us - two failed ideologies, fascism and communism. And yet when you look at the two, in practice they weren't that different. Communist Russia, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, all became totalitarian regimes under the guise that they were doing it all for the working man. That may not have been Marx and Engels' plan but that was certainly what happened and their convincing (to others that is, I certainly wasn't convinced by any of the empty arguments) arguments led millions of people to their deaths and inadvertently changed the world for the worse, hence my view that ""The Communist Manifesto"" is demonstrably not a great idea. Their utopia was like all utopias: a mirage and nothing more.

As for the rest of the manifesto, it talks a lot about different kinds of communists which was dull, it repeats the word ""bourgeois"" far too often (but then this is a propaganda leaflet so they had to hammer home the message that property and individual freedoms are bad), though there are moments of strangely poetic writing such as ""the robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe..."" (p. 42).

I found it quite a chore to read but necessary as it's a document that has had an inordinate amount of impact on our world and it's communist ideas continue to brainwash the people of North Korea and Cuba (both third world countries led by dictators). I'm glad I read it too because I learned that sometimes ideas that are meant to be beneficial to mankind can be subverted by others to exploit people and change the stated purpose to something completely different, like Nietzsches' ""Superman"" theory with Hitler's Nazi party.

5.0,True,"09 2, 2011",A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B000FC27TA,,not a natural,"Marx and Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto in 1848 at the request of the Communist League, a secret association of workers driven underground by political oppression aimed at preventing concerted revolutionary activity against bourgeois regimes throughout Europe.  The Manifesto was written to provide a theoretical foundation and a practical program for the advancement of international communism and eventual elimination of bourgeois domination of property-less wage laborers.

The title of the document, simple and purely descriptive though it is, is commonly regarded as inflammatory, arousing derision, disdain, and virulent hostility among many, including those whom it was written to benefit.  Nevertheless, there is much in the Manifesto, especially in the first chapter, that with the aid of hindsight could have been written by a contemporary neo-conservative intellectual, someone like Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell.

Specifically, Marx and Engels begin with a tribute to the unparalleled productive capacity of the capitalist organization of production.  They freely laud the technological innovations fostered by capitalists' pursuit of surplus value, a process that has dramatically transformed the forces of production and the social relations of production.  The result has been rapidly expanding output of industrial and agricultural goods of all kinds.

In accomplishing this, capital has extended its markets beyond national borders, creating a world market and a world economy.  Raw materials from Latin America, Africa, and Asia are routinely used to manufacture finished goods in England, Germany, and other European countries.  The same manufactured goods may then be sold in the very places that supplied the raw materials.

All this, Marx and Engels observe, requires concentration of vast numbers of people in swollen industrial cities.  Small manufacturers and family farms are swallowed up by larger enterprises with which they have neither the capital nor productive capacity to compete.  Marx and Engels find it particularly noteworthy that men like Thomas Jefferson had envisioned America as a land of independent yeoman farmers with small land holdings, but the concentration of agriculture was rendering this vision obsolete.

As we get farther into this brief document, Daniel Bell, the other neo-conservatives, and people generally may take angry exception to its tone and substance.

Concentration of resources in capital-intensive enterprises, Marx and Engels argue, reduces the vast majority of people to the degraded status of wage labor, workers who own nothing but their labor power.  It is in the interests of the bourgeoisie -- of capital -- to pay workers as little as possible, increasing surplus value by buying labor power for no more than its natural price, the amount needed to survive and reproduce.

The culture of workers is nothing more than a brutalizing culture of production, lacking in scope and richness due to the pitifully small part that each worker plays in the overall production process.  Families of working people are men, women, and children who labor for the natural price and have little time, energy or emotional sustenance to offer each other, having been wrung dry by capital's conditions of employment.

The more productive the worker, the more he or she strengthens the hand of capital.  However, capital's immense productive power and its success in keeping wage rates abysmally low are not an unmixed blessing for the bourgeoisie.  Periodic over-production crises wreck havoc with national and international markets, undercutting profits and threatening the commanding position of capital.  As a timely example, the U.S. economy is currently approximating an over-production crisis:  unemployment is high, wages are low and falling, capital has roughly two and a half trillion dollars to invest, but in the absence of demand the bourgeoisie has become risk averse, and money is not being invested in productive endeavors.

The long-term solution to all this, for Marx and Engels, is elimination of bourgeois property and the property relations that capitalism has created.  This is not to say that private property must altogether disappear, but private property as capital, as that which creates a two-class system of exploitation of labor by the bourgeoisie, certainly must cease to exist.

Marx and Engels were entirely too sanguine about the eventual joining together of members of the working class to present a united front in their conflict with capital.  They realized that there were ethnic, racial, religious, national, linguistic, occupational, and other barriers that would be difficult to overcome, but I doubt they expected the workers of the world to be as fractionated as is currently the case.  If Marx and Engels were alive today, they might take the view that things would have to get much worse for labor before a revolution becames possible.

If you're not inclined to read the Manifesto, just read the introductory remarks by Vladimir Posner, once a member of the Communist Party of the USSR.  Posner spent much of his childhood and adolescence in the West, and his insights into the appeal of communist ideals and the failure of the USSR to develop communism as Marx and Engels sketchily envisioned it are extremely interesting.  Posner is no apologist for anything, just an honest and intelligent journalist whose idealism is genuine but far from boundless or excessive.",Descriptively Accurate But Unduly Sanguine,1314921600,,

No other book had a more profound effect on 20th-century history in terms of lives affected, governments overthrown, nations transformed, people killed or displaced, and the expenditure of time, money, and energy either for or against it. Given the fact that America was so preoccupied with the threat of Communism for decades, it's surprising how few Americans ever took the time to read the actual battle cry of their nemesis. Due to its historical importance, Communism is a political philosophy that must either be accepted or refuted, but cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, my intention here is not to critique Communism as a philosophy but rather to critique the Manifesto as a book.

A common misconception is that this book is the founding document of Communism, but in reality Communism was well-known as an active political school in Europe at the time the Manifesto was published. The purpose of the Manifesto was to ignite and unite the faithful, recruit the curious, and frighten the bourgeoisie. The authors assumed a prior knowledge of Communism on the part of the reader, and as such the text spends more time clarifying the doctrine of Communism  than it does declaring it outright. Because it's a manifesto rather than a full-fledged philosophical treatise, its full of bold, undefended statements. Here you won't find well-reasoned arguments extolling the virtues of Communism, nor detailed explanations as to how exactly the world would be run following the triumph of the Revolution. For that you'll have to look elsewhere in Marx's oeuvre. The subject matter of the Manifesto is restricted to a description of the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, along with some general statements about the abolition of private property. There's also some discussion of how Communism differs from earlier forms of Socialism, and the state of its activity in Europe in the mid-19th century.

The Kindle file that's offered for free on Amazon was originally created by Project Gutenberg. It's a very short file, and one-fifth of it is taken up by the Project Gutenberg license agreement. The entire Manifesto can be read in under an hour. This is a no-frills file; it contains no introduction, commentary, or footnotes. There's no table of contents, but a file this small doesn't really need one. The English translation is from the 1888 edition edited by Engels. For the modern audience it's a bit of a clunky read. There are a few grammatical errors, subject-verb disagreements for example. Absent from this volume, however, are the annoying typographical errors often found in Project Gutenberg files created by optical character recognition of scanned books. In that respect the text is clean and user-friendly.

As a historical document, The Communist Manifesto is an invaluable artifact. As a philosophical text, it's brevity undermines its necessity. For any in-depth knowledge of the subject, you'll have to dive into Marx's Das Kapital.","A must read, but not necessarily a must like",1314662400,,

In any area of academics, I tend to search for those thinkers who have had ideas that, I believe, would not exist had that thinker not thought of them.  The most fascinating of these ideas are those that greatly impact the world.  My opinion is that Marx satisfied both of these criteria.

If anything is to be learned from Communist Manifesto, one must adhere to the eastern philosophic principle of unlearning everything you know, before you read this book.  This work requires great rumination, and I mean this in a way that is as unbiased as possible.  Then, when you add in political and economic considerations, psychology, and even philosophy such as that of Hobbes, can this book be useful to us.  I think people who have much more liberal views tend to cling to this and learn very little from it and, conversely, people of a conservative bent dismiss it before they begin reading it.

In all great works, such as this, there is some amount of truth that needs recovering.  No one work that I know of is completely true from start to finish, so I think this book presents a great challenge to all readers in that it requires a well-develop mind, a mind that seeks objectivity and truth, to discern the accurate points made by Marx and those points that don't reflect reality.  Based on human nature, can a society function economically and sociologically without incentive, and based on communal property?  I doubt it.  On the flipside, if there were no validity to this work, then why is there a minimum wage?

Given that it is a free edition, it has no table of contents or hyperlinks, but given that this is basically a pamphlet, it is not really that important.  I was easy to use the `search this book' option to find the 4 different sections the start with the roman numerals I through IV.  I also like the `popular highlights' feature on the kindle, of which 3 or 4 sentences were highlighted that people thought were interesting.  They were quotes that we worth noting.

Marx' pamphlet was clearly written and did a good job of presenting his ideas.  I summarize the main sections below.

The first section is a summary of the class struggles between the proletariats and the bourgeois, or the oppressed and the oppressors.  He actually does a good job pointing out many actual problems.

The second section describes the relationship between proletarians and communists.  He makes it clear that the aim of communists is to overthrow the bourgeois class to be replaced with the proletariat class.

The third section describes the socialist and communist literature and describes each type of socialism.  He clearly dislikes socialists almost as much as he does capitalists.

The fourth section was a summary of the differences between communism and various other opposition parties, mostly socialists.  He dislikes most of them because they do not go far enough in overthrowing the existing systems of government.

I was struck by his belief that swapping the two classes would result in a permanent fix to the problem.  History has born out that empowering the oppressed class just turns them eventually into oppressors.  Communists eventually become an elite class and there still becomes a less privileged class.  The incentive to excel becomes stifled and overall prosperity suffers.

This was worth reading and is a good reminder to all of us to do everything we can to prevent a class of people from feeling oppressed.

This edition - Penguin Classics - has an ""introduction"". I put that between quotation marks (Marx? never mind...) because said introduction is 218 pages in length, and the Communist Manifesto per se is about 40 pages. That's right, the introduction is over five times longer than the text itself.

Here's the problem with this: this introductory essay - easily the longest I have ever, ever seen in a Penguin Classics book - seems to be very good, except for the fact that it gives so much information about everything, that I couldn't read it all because I didn't really care about that level of details! I know it sounds like a lame argument, but the point of the matter is that if this specialised knowledge is worth your time, you probably already have read the Communist Manifesto. This introduction is far too big for the reader who just wants to read the Communist Manifesto, and far too specialised.

So after I skipped five thirds of the book, and got to the actual Manifesto, I was disappointed. Everything I knew about Communism wasn't there much. It talks about social classes and such, as you'd expect, but oddly, I didn't feel like it read like a manifesto. At any rate, I expected far more arguments. Instead, all you get is, roughly, a description of what Communism is, and by ""Communism"", I mean the type you had in 1840, which may or may not have all that much to do with the Communism we all know. Can't blame Marx for that, but instead of 218 pages of introduction on the details of what led to the manifesto, maybe more about 20th century Communism? Maybe other texts? Maybe excerpts from The Capital? I don't know, but 218 pages of introduction for such a short text should be justified, very justified, and in my opinion, it wasn't. I feel like I bought two books instead of one. No doubt, this introductory essay is precious for anyone who studies Karl Marx, and that's exactly why I doubt that a Penguin Classics is the right place to have it. Only specialists will enjoy it, and people who have never read the Communist Manifesto will not be so interested. 218 pages of intro, and 40 pages of main text, I had never seen that before.

And after reading those 40 something pages of manifesto, I feel let down. I expected more. I thought Marx would develop much more in this text. Everything is upside down: the introduction is the size of a novel and develops everything to extremities I could not bring myself to be interested in, and the main text is the size of an introduction, develops little, and obviously addresses people of that time (quite logically, for a manifesto) and leaves one in an unsatisfying blur.

Not worth your time. Had I known, I would still have read it because I like to know things first hand, but I now believe I would be better off with a book ABOUT Communism rather than this manifesto and its gargantuan introduction.

Very disappointed. Check the intro if you're a political student or if you're very interested in Marxism or 19th century history, but if you're into Communism, I suggest getting something else.

A note to Communists/Socialists- Marx/Engels state that it is high time that you are open about your views and aims. Be honest.

There is an argument against current Capitalist society as having ""agglomerated population, centralized means of productions and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralization."" Which I must argue, sounds like the definition of Fascism...not Capitalism.

So what is the cure for this disease? Centralization of property and power to the State. oh, that makes perfect sense. So now, all the mega-property owners can maintain status quo- playing footsie with politicians and even becoming those that govern. Sounds like musical chairs.

The industrial process destabilized all hierarchies and subverted all sacred and secular inherited beliefs and practices. It turned everything everywhere into an object for sale.
But, it also liberated people from backwardness and tradition-bound dependence.

The Communist Manifesto splits the world in two hostile camps: the Bourgeoisie (the haves, the owners of the means of production) and the Proletariat (the have-nots).

The Bourgeoisie tore asunder the feudal society. It left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest (cash payments). It created one freedom: free trade.
But the Bourgeoisie also created its nemesis, the Proletariat, a class of labourers who can live only so long as they find work and who can only find work if their labour increases capital (is profitable).

In order to survive, all Proletarians should unite all over the world in order to conquer political power and to create a free society.
This free society should be attained by the following measures: abolition of all private property, of the family nucleus, of all countries and nationalities, of all religions and moralities, of all rights of inheritance and of all child labour.
All production instruments (industry, property, banking) should be centralized in the hands of the State (monopolies). There should be a heavy progressive income tax and free education for everyone.

Of course, this manifesto is partly extremely utopian (contrarian to biological `gene' interests) and far too optimistic about the `proletarian' management of State monopolies.

Of course, reading the Manifesto now, it is nearly impossible to separate this small ideological work from the historical events before, during, and after the Cold War that indelibly etched people's impressions of ""Communism"" into their minds.  Adherents of Communism protest that the regimes in the USSR and China under Stalin and Mao were not truly ""communist"" (and they are likely correct in their protestation), but the reality is that for most people born and raised on this side of the Iron Curtain, the communist ideology of Marx and Engels became inseparable from the communism-in-practice of self-identified communists like Mao, Kim, Castro, and Stalin.

Full of pessimism about the old order and hope for a new one, the reader cannot help but be absorbed by the text from the first mention of the ""spectre of Communism"" haunting Europe to the final cry for the working man to cast off his chains and unite.  There is passion, youthfulness, and idealism behind the words; an urgency captured by an appeal more to the heart than to the mind.  After all, this is an intendedly propagandist piece for mobilizing the working class: Marx and Engels probably figured, what proletarian has time to read and digest the vast tome of Das Kapital?

Put into its historical context, however, perhaps it should not be so shocking that a work like the Manifesto emerged given the circumstances.  A series of revolutions and restorations marked the violent death throes of feudalism, which did not go quietly into the night.  Seeing the end of a political, economic, and social order that had reigned supreme over Europe for centuries, it should not be surprising that Marx did not place much faith in the permanence of the status quo, nor did he underestimate the power of insurrection.  It should not be all that surprising that class struggle and the oppression of the working class should capture Marx's attention either, for we only need to read the works of history or the fiction of his contemporaries to know that the gap between the ""haves"" and have-nots"" in the beginning of the industrial age was quite extreme.  This is clear, whether one is reading the Manifesto or Oliver Twist.  Social issues of poverty, illiteracy, poor health care, etc. makes the plight of the exploited understandably dire and immediate.  It is no wonder that Marx expected capitalism as he knew it to sow the seeds of its own ruin.

But what happened was not the collapse of capitalism, but its evolution.  The fact that modern readers are as horrified by the conditions described by Dickens as Marx was speaks to the fact that capitalism and social progress are not mutually exclusive phenomena.  The reality is that just as ""pure"" Communism has never been practiced, neither has ""pure"" Capitalism.  Remembering that Adam Smith was as much moral philosopher as (political) economist, this is not so surprising.  Indeed, it is interesting that of the ten policies clearly articulated by Marx in the Manifesto, a number of them (progressive taxation, strong central banks, free education, etc.) are in practice in capitalist societies around the world today.  Some have argued that this simply represents the adoption of Marxist ideas into capitalism, but let's remember that Adam Smith advocated a progressive tax long before Karl Marx did.  What's more important is the fact that disparate theories can apparently support strikingly similar policies.  For me, I think it's important to recognize that all systems of social organization have their warts, and that all systems can learn something from the others: no single ideology has a monopoly on good ideas.

My intent is not to get into a discussion of the relative merits of capitalism versus communism, because others have already done so much more elegantly and persuasively than I.  My final point to make is that I believe the Communist Manifesto is a book that should be read, regardless of where you stand on the political and economic spectrum.  It is a book of importance given its immense influence on subsequent historical events.  It is also a valuable reminder that the economic, political, and social spheres are very much interrelated in their evolution.  A diversity of opinions can only serve to improve the status quo, and it is my hope that readers can approach the Manifesto with an objective mind for critical analysis of its merits and its flaws.",An important work of historical significance,1231027200,,

The problem is, ""...absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" and when authoritarian dictators implement these ideas it always results in two percent of the people having everything and the remaining ninety-eight percent having nothing.

The core focus of this political persuasion is on ""the worker"". It evolved from a prior eternity of monarchs dominating the poor and a response to the scourge of serfdom. Ultimately, Lenin used ""The Communist Manifesto"" as a means of promoting the Russian Revolution which ultimately became the cultural horror which the rest of us came to know as The Soviet Union. In other words, it provided the basis for a ploy on the part of the Bolsheviks (Communist Party).

During the years of Communism, the Soviet workers used to convey a covertly-spoken credo: ""We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us"". That pretty much sums up how Marx's and Engels' plan played out in actual practice.

Strangely, few people ever make the observation that the ideas of Marx and Engels were not at all original. Thomas More (1478-1535) conveyed almost the same concept when he scribed his famous work:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thomas-More-s-Utopia/dp/1604500301/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thomas More's Utopia</a>.

It is extremely interesting that historical information presented to support the need for communism is misrepresented, either accidentally (by mistake) or on purpose (a lie). For example, the authors state that the Industrial Revolution caused widespread destitution and wage-slave misery by removing European / UK workers from their agrarian lives in the country. The reality is that literal starvation and death from disease were often widespread before the Industrial Revolution.

That event, the application of machinery to the manufacturing process, significantly upgraded the lives and incomes of those who participated. One example is clothing. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most clothing was made of wool. It could not be washed, or it would shrink. People of the lower class -- the overwhelming majority class -- wore unsanitary, uncomfortable clothing year-round. After steam engines were applied to the weaving process, inexpensive cotton cloth enabled the abundant manufacture of durable, washable clothing to which everyone had ready access. The Industrial Revolution, a product of capitalism, upgraded human existence to a degree never before seen in the world.

Again, this is definitely an important book to read -- for the right reasons.

I found it difficult to decide how to rate this book. The presentation of Manifesto by Penguin in this book is excellent. The central ideas of the Manifesto itself are disturbing.

Should you read the Communist Manifesto? Yes. Is this a good presentation? Yes. Was Communism envisioned by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels a good idea? No.  So I have compromised between the excellent presentation and the ideas espoused by the Manifesto in selecting an average rating.

Some reviewers feel that the Manifesto's critique of capitalism is right on; I have grave doubts. Marx and Engels were critiquing capitalism from an ivory tower. Their remedies for capitalism show that they had no real experience or contact with the workers in the trenches.

Some reviewers have mentioned the changing of labor laws due to the Manifesto, such as child labor laws (a generally agreed good thing). I believe those laws would have changed if the Manifesto had never been written. I believe those reviewers are seeing cause and effect relationships where there is none. I believe labor leaders in non-Communist states, pushing for change in labor laws, did not need belief in Communism behind them to push for change. Even without Communism, they would have done what they did anyways because the labor leaders came up from the laboring trenches. They knew first hand the abuses going on. The writers of the Manifesto did not; their ideas were theoretical. I know my ideas, in this area, are conjectures of what would have happened without the Manifesto, without Communism; there is no way they can be proven, history cannot be rewritten.

The remedy proposed by Marx and Engels is frightening. It foreshadows exactly how Communism gave birth to totalitarian states, to Communist dictatorships. Their remedy for capitalism requires a select group of leaders (Communist elitists) to force Communism onto the populace for the good of the people.  We should all be suspicious of anyone who professes an idea that is for the good of the people because it invariably is not good for the people. To paraphase Lord Acton, ""power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" and the states envisioned by the writers of the Manifesto set up perfect conditions of absolute power (for the good of the people) which in practice led to absolutely corrupt power. History has shown there has been extreme abuse by Communist leaders, who became power meglomanics, of the masses of workers in their states.

Indeed, history has repeatedly shown that the concentration of power in the hands of a select few led to abuse of power.  The smaller the select, the greater the abuse. This has been true regardless of the political theories espoused by the leaders. Let this be a cautionary tale to all of us.",Political Classic...read for historical insight,1182902400,,

The trouble is caused by the fact that humans absolutely cannot live an ideal existence.  Thus, a strong centralized government is created to force people to live that idealized existence, which just causes upset, rebellion and greed.  But I wander afield.

Below is a review of this document that I wrote in 2006 and proudly stand by today.

If you are a revolutionary, a radical or merely a liberal activist you must come to terms with the theory outlined in the Communist Manifesto. Today's political activists are obviously not the first to face this challenge. Radicals, revolutionaries and liberals have had to come to terms with the Manifesto at least since 1848, when it was first published.  That same necessity; perhaps surprisingly to some given the changes in the political landscape since then, is true today. Why surprisingly? On the face of it, given the political times, it would appear somewhat absurd to make such a claim about the necessity of coming to terms with the overriding need for the revolutionary overturn of the capitalist order outlined in the Manifesto. It, however, is.

With the collapses of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-influenced Eastern European states about fifteen years ago, which were supposedly based on Marxist concepts, one would think that Marxism was a dead letter. But hear me out. Even the less far-sighted apologists for the international capitalist order are now worrying about the increasing gap between rich and poor, not only between the so-called first and third worlds but also within the imperial metropolitan centers themselves. Nowhere is that more evident that in the United States where that gap has dramatically increased over the last thirty years. Thus, despite the carping of the `death of communism' theorists after the decisive capitulation of international Stalinism in the early 1990's, an objective criterion exists today to put the question posed by the ongoing class struggle and of the validity of a materialist concept of history back on the front burner.

Whether one agrees with the Marxian premises about the need for revolution and for a dialectical materialist conception of the workings of society or not one still must, if for no other reason that to be smart about the doings of the world, confront the problem of how to break the stalemate over where human history is heading. 'Globalization' has clearly demonstrated only that the 'race to the bottom' inherent in the inner workings of capitalism is continuing at full throttle. Moreover, the contradictions and boom/bust cycles of capitalism have not been resolved. And those results have not been pretty for the peoples of the world.

Experience over the last 160 years has shown that those who are not armed with a materialist concept of history, that is, the ability to see society in all its workings and contradictions, cannot understand the world. All other conceptual frameworks lead to subjectivist idealism and utopian concepts of social change, at best. One may ultimately answer the questions posed by the Manifesto in the negative but the alternatives leave one politically defenseless in the current one-sided international class war.

So what is the shouting over Marxism, pro and con, all about? In the middle of the 19th century, especially in Europe, it was not at all clear where the vast expansion and acceleration of industrial society was heading. All one could observe was that traditional society was being rapidly disrupted and people were being uprooted, mainly from the land, far faster than at any time in previous history. For the most part, political people at that time reacted to the rise of capitalism with small plans to create utopian societies off on the side of society or with plans to smash the industrial machinery in order to maintain an artisan culture (the various forms of Ludditism). Into this chaos a young Karl Marx stepped in, and along with his associate and co-thinker Friedrich Engel, gave a, let us face it, grandiose plan for changing all of society based on the revolutionary overthrow of existing society.

Marx thus did not based himself on creation of some isolated utopian community but rather took the then current level of international capitalist society as a starting point and expanded his thesis from that base. Now that was then, and today still is, a radical notion. Marx, however, did not just come to those conclusions out of the blue. As an intellectual (and frustrated academian) he took the best of German philosophy (basically from Hegel, then the rage of German philosophical academia), French political thought and revolutionary tradition especially the Great French Revolution of the late 1700'and English political economy.

In short, Marx took the various strands of Enlightenment thought and action and grafted those developments onto a theory, not fully formed at the time, of how the proletariat was to arise and take over the reins of society for the benefit of all of society and end class struggle as the motor force of history. Unfortunately, given the rocky road of socialist thought and action over the last 160 years, we are, impatiently, still waiting for that new day.

In recently re-reading the Manifesto this writer was struck by how much of the material in it related, taking into account the technological changes and advances in international capitalist development since 1848, to today's political crisis of humankind. Some of the predictions and some of the theory are off, no question, particularly on the questions of the relative staying power of capitalism, the relative impoverishment of the masses, the power of the nation-state and nationalism to cut across international working class solidarity and the telescoping of the time frame of capitalist development but the thrust of the material presented clearly speaks to us today. Maybe that is why today the more far-sighted bourgeois commentators are nervous at the reappearance of Marxism in Western society as a small but serious current in the international labor movement. Militant leftists can now argue- Stalinism (the horrendous distortion of Marxism) never again, to the bourgeois commentators' slogan of - socialist revolution, never again.

As a historical document one should read the Manifesto with the need for updating in mind. The reader should nevertheless note the currency of the seemingly archaic third section of the document where Marx polemicized against the leftist political opponents of his time. While the names of the organizations of that time have faded away into the historical mist the political tendencies he argued against seem to very much analogous to various tendencies today. In fact, in my youth I probably argued in favor of every one of those tendencies that Marx opposed before I was finally won over to the Marxian worldview. I suggest that not only does humankind set itself the social tasks that it can reasonably perform but also that when those tasks are not performed there is a tendency to revert to earlier, seemingly defeated ideas, of social change. Thus the resurgent old pre-Marxian conceptions of societal change have to be fought out again by this generation of militant leftists. That said, militant leftists should read and reread this document. It is literarily the foundation document of the modern communist movement. One can still learn much from it. Forward.

The 1800s provided many great works of political thought; few of which can compare in importance as this short tract by Karl Marx.  Along with Das Kapital, this was one of the first major works in human history to link economics with sociology and political institutions, this text has done for economic liberty and equality what the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence has done for political liberty and equality.  Written by Marx as part propaganda to invoke change, and part retribution to his enemies; intellectual and otherwise, this book has inspired political movements ever since.

In short, the book argues for equality, security, and freedom in the economic realm.  Specifically, Marx lays out a series of planks, or reforms, that he believes societies should undertake to solve the problems of laissez-faire capitalism.  These include the abolition of child labor, public funding of a universal social security program, a minimum wage, progressive taxation, free public education for all children irregardless of heritage, employee-financed disability benefits, universal health care, etc...

If one looks thru at the ensuing 150 years since its initial publication; those nations that have seen the highest raises in standards of living are those that have implemented the majority of these reforms.  These nations include Singapore, Canada, post-WWII Japan, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, and the USA.  If one looks within nations, such as the USA for example, those states with the higher standards of living generally have adopted more of these reforms at an ealier date than those states with a lower standard of living.  I measure standard of living by criteria such as life expectancy, infant mortality rate, crime rates, rates of incarceration, etc...

Critical throughout all these nations is the enfranchisement of a greater percentage of the population in both economic and political rights.  Democracy and equality are the keys here, whether it be in local elections, stockholder meetings, or decision making inside corporations.  Democracy and equality are what Marx argued for in this work, though he does so in a language we in the 21st century find hard to decipher.

Likewise, those nations that have witnessed the worst standards of living are those that have mostly ignored the ideas in this book.  Maoist China and the USSR under Stalin are the two ideal examples.  Contrary to the popular view of conservatives and mainstream thought, neither of these countries examplified communism.  Both examplified one thing and one thing only; dictatorships of a few over the many.  In both countries, it is the few who control the resources, make the decisions, and make the profits.  The rest of the population sacrifice and work.  Both Maoist China and the USSR are essentially aristocracies.

Overall, I highly recommend this book.  Read it slowly and read it carefully; then look at the history of the world since then.

Classics of this magnitude, whether Adam Smith's THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, Tocqueville's DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA, or THE FEDERALIST PAPERS have achieved a status that makes the assigning of a rating rather silly.  Regardless of one's feelings about Marxism or Communism, a work of such gigantic influence is of such a status that rating it is almost silly.  It is one of the constitutive artifacts of our culture.

The particular edition I am reviewing is the recent reissue on Verso with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm.  There are a host of editions of THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO, and virtually any of them will do the trick, but I very much enjoyed this edition, partly for the handsome jacket and binding, and partly for the superb intro by Hobsbawm.  It is not a new translation, and indeed it isn't clear that there will ever be much of a demand for a new translation.  The MANIFESTO was first published in 1848 and this translation in 1888.  Moore's translation is the standard one for a simple reason:  Engels examined it closely and helped Moore in editing the final draft of the translation.

Although I had read a fair amount in the writings of Marx over the years, this was my first time to read the work from cover to cover.  I found it surprising on several levels.  First, it was a much easier to read work than I had anticipated.  This is upon reflection hardly surprising.  The work was intended as a pamphlet for the masses, and it was essential that it be as understandable as possible.  Also, the concepts and ideas articulated in these pages have become a part of the intellectual landscape of Western civilization.  A host of ideas are commonplace, even among those who do not consider themselves sympathetic towards Marxism.  It has become a commonplace of the past decade that Communism and Democracy clashed, and Communism lost.  But the fact is that Marxist thought has exerted a massive influence on the way we view the world, and many things introduced by Marx are now central constituents of our world.  Just look at the way we write history now.  Before Marx a detailed consideration of the economic factors in an era was unheard of; now it is considered essential.

As a credo, I find myself conflicted over its contents, just as I always find myself conflicted in reading Marx.  Marx's analyses of the dynamics governing capitalist society have always struck me as dead on.  No one writes more presciently or timelessly about the structures of exploitation that are inherent in capitalism.  Nonetheless, I find his positive proposals as to how to transcend capitalism to be untenable, and the post-capitalist world he describes to be undesirable.  The best way to express this is that I find Marx the critic to be convincing and impressive, but Marx the visionary to be irrelevant.  I want us to pay attention to Marx's critiques, but not to his proposals for change.

I was delighted in reading the book to find the word ""highfalutin"" in the text.  The world seems somehow to be a more charming place for the unexpected presence of such a light-hearted word in the midst of a serious text.

Though listed as the work of Marx and Engels, Marx was the primary creator of the work.  He also did the bulk of the writing.  It isn't sufficiently commented on what a beautiful writer Marx could be when he tried.  Too often he adopts the try academic style begun with Christian Wolff and continued by Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.  But a host of exquisite phrases such as ""All that is solid melts into air"" shows that Marx could turn a phrase when conviction didn't prevent him.

Everyone interested in political thought or modern history needs to read this book.  Its influence--its ongoing influence--is incalculable.  Its critique of the exploitative nature of capitalism remains astonishingly relevant.  And its predictions about the future course of history, even if no longer inspiring or convincing, are crucial to grasp if one is to understand many of the political impulses of the past one hundred and fifty years.",An excellent edition of a political classic,1092009600,,

Marx's economic beliefs suggest that the working class will rise up and overthrow the rich/ruling class in order to create a classless society. Their are several flaws that have been historically pointed out in relation to Marx's theory.  The most common flaw would suggest that Marx never foresaw the advent of a middle class society which is content unlike the working class.  This makes any revolution unlikely. One question to ask is ""Are people greedy?"" If you believe people are greedy, then the theories of Marx can not work. Greedy people could not allow themselves to be equal in the amount of toys they have with the general population. Greed would destroy communism just as it did in the Soviet Union.  The greed of some is one of the ultimate reasons the Soviet Union collapsed.  However, Cuba is still survivng and Castro as seen as a saint in Cuba.

One example is cotton; industrialization so increased the utilization of cotton that cloth became affordable to everyone -- people very quickly, for the first time in history, had access to inexpensive, clean and serviceable clothing.

And there is the reality that people simply are not equal in ability, initiative, intelligence, energy and other productive attributes.  The elimination of profits in enterprises is a certain way to smother productivity and create equality.... equality of destitution.  Most curious is why the authors attacked capitalism.

Recently I re-read it and was amazed at how clear it seemed and what an effective piece of propaganda it was and how clear was the writing.
Reading through the program one realises the distance that has been travelled since it was written. Some of the major planks are the Abolition of Child Labour, the creation of a progressive income tax and Free Education.
Perhaps one of its major weaknesses is that Marx was a person who tended to carry a grudge. Thus a third of it is devoted to attacks on some of his contemporary enemies and rivals. These disputes have so long passed into history they are incomprehensible.
The modern notion of Communism of course stems not from Marx but from Stalin and Lenin. Marx wrote at a time when the only democratic country in Europe was France. England, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire all had limited franchises and Russia was of course an autocracy.  One of the major reforms he battled for was the introduction of democracy. It was his belief that the implementation of his program would flow from that.
Following Marx's death his movement evolved into a parliamentary movement the Social Democratic Party.  Communism as a modern political phenomena dates from 1917 when splinter Social Democrats followed Russia's lead and developed small conspiratorial parties who were committed to the seizure of power by force.

Reading through the Manifesto one can see the basis of a system which was not only an effective for mobilising political movements, but came to influence intellectual debate for the next century.

In all the cases the experience usually changed the person in many mysterious and joyful ways.  I found this 149 page hardcover book (My descent into death: A second chance at life by Howard Storm with the forward by Anne Rice) in our local library at the free book section.

  I was  impressed reading this book because of the authors sincere and heartwarming story on his near-death experiences which happened while visiting Paris, France.  His serious stomach pain caused him to slip out of his early body and unlike most near-death experiences, this one began with demons giving him the most horrid experience he ever felt.

What made this an interesting story was the author was saved from these demons with his recognition and love from God and his angels.  Strangely for me, before I became a Reiki master I would have dismissed this book and the authors experiences as delusional and mystical; however, I have become more open minded to some of the spiritual experiences of people.
The material in this book covers the following short chapters: Paris, the descent, alone, the light, life review, the past and the future, what happens when we die, why we are the way we are, reality, the argument, waking up, Lisa and Clarence, sent back, next to heaven, limbo, telling the story, a second chance at life, angels, pilgrim and afterword.

If you are seeking sincere experiences involving near-death and visions of God and angels you may want to check out this interesting book, which you can get for a bargain price on amazon.

You are not invited to send donations to an address, not encouraged to send your e-mail for a monthly newsletter, not asked to do anything but read an astonishing story.

 There is very little that I liked about the novel.  The character of Jane Maguire bears no resemblance to an actual person.

I was anxious to read Jane and Trevor's ongoing relationship, but my thoughts were 'get it on already'. The sex seemed forced and I did not feel the attraction like in the previous book. I love Iris Johansen, but I agree with other readers, her style is once again changing. She went through the transition with Ugly Duckling which proved to be well worth it, but the last couple of books are suddenly steering away from the romantic suspense genre and leaning toward straight fiction. She still has a talent for creating some of the best twists and turns and surprise endings, but I really wish she would create another book like The Killing Game. That is the one that made us all fall in love with Eve and Joe.

Okay, now that I've gotten off the track. Countdown is not bad. Hopefully the next book will have more romance for Jane and Trevor.

They --- and Johansen fans in general --- will be pleased to find that her latest book resolves a number of the issues left open in BLIND ALLEY while creating a couple of new ones for future novels to deal with.

COUNTDOWN occurs some four years after the events of BLIND ALLEY. Jane MacGuire, now a 21-year-old college student, is a success by any definition as she juggles work, education, friends, and family with equal aplomb. She is still haunted, however, by the memory of the intriguing, enigmatic, and dangerous Mark Trevor. When an attempted kidnapping of MacGuire ends unsuccessfully, but nonetheless tragically, Trevor makes a sudden and dramatic return into MacGuire's life. Trevor, for the sake of MacGuire's safety, spirits her away to an ancient, brooding castle in Scotland, where the two of them must confront their unresolved and unrefined feelings for each other while dealing with the dangers of the outside world.

MacGuire also finds that renewed contact with Trevor results in a resumption of the enigmatic haunting dreams that previously had troubled her. These dreams involve a woman named Cira, a proud slave of the Roman Empire who seems to lie at the heart of a mystery that spans two millenniums and that involves a treasure of immeasurable historical and monetary wealth.

As in BLIND ALLEY, Trevor is aligned against those who feel that MacGuire holds the key to the mystery of the treasure's whereabouts. But the stakes are much higher in COUNTDOWN. One of the treasure seekers has entered into a mutual aid agreement with terrorists who threaten the United States. MacGuire and Trevor ultimately find themselves in a race against time and distance as they leave safety and security to bring the battle home --- and to hopefully solve the mystery of Cira's treasure.

Fans of BLIND ALLEY will be thrilled with COUNTDOWN. The novel fully comes to terms with the relationship between Trevor and MacGuire, while leaving the possibility of more --- or less --- between them open for the future. There also is an extremely interesting development concerning MacGuire's heritage coming totally out of left field that provides a possible key to the dreams that have haunted her for so long.

Johansen therefore simultaneously satisfies readers who were seeking resolution of issues left open at the end of BLIND ALLEY while leaving them wanting more after COUNTDOWN. This is an enviable position for an author, and one that Johansen is sure to utilize to its fullest in future books.

Eve Duncan's ward, Jane MacGuire, is now at Harvard and is 21 so 4 years have passed since the last book.  She is close to Mike who is a ward of Eve's mom.  Jane is always helping people out of scrapes and feels particularly responsible for Mike.  His roommate calls her that Mike is drunk and morose at a bar.  Jane goes to get him and take him home but on the way to the car they are attacked and Mike is shot and killed.

It turns out the kidnappers were really after Jane and Mike was just in the way.  Mark Trevor, from ""Blind Alley"", has been keeping an eye on Jane due to the search for Cira's gold.  He decides to ""rescue"" her and persuades her to come with him to Scotland where he has a translator working to discover where Cira's gold is.

Lots of secondary characters are introduced including the laird of the castle, MacDuff, his ward, Jock who is a very disturbed young man, and Mario Donato, the translator.  Back from the last book also is Barlett who is a very loyal and funny character.

While we do know the villain(s) in this book early on, the possible tragedies setup and the dicey situations keep the suspense going.  Also, the bit of mysticism with Jane's strange and realistic dreams of Cira also keep the story very interesting.  We get to know Jane and Trevor quite a bit better although I would still like to know them more.

Eve and Joe have only minor parts while some of the secondary characters are developed pretty well and play major roles.  If you liked ""Blind Alley"", you will probably like this book.  If you didn't like it or don't like any ""mysticism"", this will not be a good plot for you.

Carnton set on the edge of the bloody battlefied and was quickly filled both inside and out with the dead and dying and many with gruesome, life-altering injuries.  There is much more human interest and resulting relationships explored in this novel than there is about the actual waging of the battle, although the military parts are actually beautifully written and terribly engaging.

Carrie, her husband, John, and their slaves were all drawn into the unending demands of the retreating armies and overwhelmed with the men left in their care.  Carrie's two young children romped about among amputees, the sightless, and the mortally wounded with gaping parts of themselves altered or missing.  The events following the battle remake Carrie into the person she believe God has always expected her to become.  She, helped by her life-long servant, Mariah, and to a lesser extent her husband and Zachariah, the soldier she inexplicably falls in love with, finds an inner strength and goes on through the rest of her life to save and protect both the living and the dead who fall in Franklin and find themselves in her charge.  She reburied almost 1,500 dead soldiers on the grounds of Carnton to protect them from being plowed over in their original graves on the battlefield.  Until her death in 1905, she walked the cemetery daily and oversaw the graves with loving attention.  Her cemetery is now maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  In the 1980's, the foundation began efforts to restore Carnton.  There are wonderful photos of Carrie, Mariah, John, the cemetery and Carnton in the author's notes at the end...worth reading.

After reading it, the only thing it has in common with ""The Killer Angels"" is that they both take place during the Civil War.

It starts out with great promise and in fact has a decent ending chapter, but everything else between was a let down. At times I felt like the book was transforming into a historical romance novel or at its worst a bad Lifetime movie. Now, there's nothing wrong with historical romance novels, but that's not the kind of book I wanted to read.

If the purpose of the book was to make you care about Carrie McGavock, for me at least, it fails. I'm sure the real Mrs. McGavock was a very interesting person, but I doubt she was anything like the person portrayed in this book. Her ""romance"" is so unbelievable and based on such pure fiction that it makes me wonder how angry the real Carrie McGavock would be if she could read it...not to mention how the real Mr. McGavock would feel about it. Meanwhile the man at the center of her attraction is unlikeable and comes across as ignorant. Why Mrs. McGavock would feel attracted to him all the while her husband just stands by and accepts it is never understood. Her husband is a kind gentleman who has given her everything and would do anything for her. She feels nothing for him for most of the book (for no reason given in the book) yet falls for this guy who is rude, stupid and has breath that smells like rotting hay...makes no sense and is borderline defamation of character.

The real story of Carrie McGavock takes place in the house turned hospital and in the last twenty pages of the book. Everything else just feels like words to make the book longer and to make Carrie McGavock seem more 21st century rather than what she probably actually was.

In this fictionalization, the author spends the first 300 pages or so recounting the battle of Franklin, Tennessee in exhausting, gruesome detail. He also concocts a bizarre romance between Carrie McGavock, the mistress of Carnton plantation, and a Confederate sergeant from Arkansas. In the last 100 or so pages, Carrie battles the evil, rich landowner who wants to plow under the dead in his field to plant more cotton.

In my opinion, the smarmy sentimentality only did Carrie's story a disservice. I couldn't help but think of Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") as the evil Mr. Baylor who wants to plow under the dead, and when the farmers band together to help dis-inter the dead and move them to Carrie's yard, it was a little too reminiscent of the final scene of that same movie when everyone brings money for George Bailey.

Carrie McGavock builds a relationship with Zachariah Cashwell, one of the soldiers who has lost his leg. Both of the characters are extraordinary in the fact that they both have such a strong and odd (in that the quality of their lives is questionable) desire to survive and to live. The story, which is more than just about the South or the Civil War (in fact, sometimes I forgot that I was reading a Civil War novel), is about survival during the most horrible moments of life. It isn't so much about the war and why it was fought, but about the people who were forced to fight it, and lost. The most amazing part of this novel is the brilliant style, which is absolutely modernist and psychologically driven (perfect for the end of the Civil War as style and system broke down), capturing the characters and making them real, poetic, beautiful, and fascinating.

Robert Hicks, in his debut work of fiction, sets out to prove otherwise.  With his own research around Franklin, TN, he has gathered facts and anecdotes to bolster his story of the infamous battle fought in this region.  With his own history as a Southerner, he has unique insight into the mindset of those involved in the battle.  But is he able to turn these strengths into a gripping tale which orbits the grim servitude of one Carrie McGavock, a woman who has lost three of her own children and now finds herself immersed in the lives of soldiers wounded and dying?

Quite simply...Yes!  ""The Widow of the South"" beautifully threads together the lives of the poor and rich, the slaves and free, the living and dying.  Carrie McGavock finds her home turned into a field hospital for the wounded and, in the process, finds a Confederate soldier who reminds her that life is worth living.  Zachariah Cashwell has cheated death on the battlefield, but now he wants out of this life.  Carrie stirs in him the will to carry on.

After some protracted musings, the narrative draws the characters together for a satisfying, though somewhat sudden ending.  The inner workings of their hearts and minds are paralleled by the war's cruelty, resolution, and long-term consequences.

  The Carnton plantation (owned by John McGavock the husband of Carrie) was turned into a hospital. Four dead Confederate Generals were laid out in death on the porch of Carnton.

  In the years following the war it was Carrie McGavock who reburied the Confederate dead in her family cemetery. When Oscar Wilde visited the US he had already heard of this remarkable woman.

  It is around this skeletal framwork that first time novelist Robert Hicks tells the story of Carrie and her family. Along the way their is romance, murder, mystery and meditations on the nature of life and death; chaos and order, memory and hope.

However, The Widow of the South failed to grab me and take me to the world of its characters and time setting alike.  The Widow of the South is a fictional account on the life of Carrie McGavock, a grieving Confederate wife who has lost interest in life in general after the Civil War battle begins and her home is commandeered for a field hospital and cemetery.  She lives a miserable life after the death of three of her children, and pays little attention to her remaining living children and of her plantation, which is now under the care of a slave called Mariah.  Carrie lives quite a lonely, empty existence, wearing black gowns all the time, grieving the loss of her children.

The scenes centered on the battles and the things people go through due to the war are rather riveting at times and I enjoyed that part of the novel very much.  However, the story of Carrie and Zachariah put me off this story.  This ""love story,"" though dark and morbid at times, wasn't interesting or literary to me in the slightest.  I was left wishing that the author had continued to concentrate more on the Civil War than on interactions between these two characters.  And so, the overall novel failed to grab me at that point.  Also, I wanted to know more about Carrie, about her grief and her children and about her husband, stories that weren't developed enough for my taste.

But a fierce battle is about to take place in Franklin, Tennessee, pitting loyal Confederate soldiers against a staunch Union Army that greatly outnumbers them. An outlaying plantation named Carnton belongs to John and Carrie McGavock. General Nathan Bedford Forrest orders the house and grounds to become a hospital for the anticipated wounded and dying. Mrs. McGavock is reclusive because she grieves for her three children, dead in the recent past. She is unwilling to turn her home into a respite for any army, but the General is firm in his demand.

More than 9,000 men die on the battlefield at Franklin in the following days. The Confederacy is near its demise; its loss at Franklin is a step closer to eventual surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. Carrie's close friend and former slave, Mariah, stands beside her for support when hundreds of broken bodies are brought to Carnton.

In historical memory, perhaps Franklin is not a formidable one. But Robert Hicks writes its story and brings to life the men who fought, healed or died there. The romantic interest in THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH is between two unlikely personalities --- Carrie McGavock and a Confederate Sergeant named Zachariah Cashwell. He's severely wounded and transported to Carnton; Carrie finds him a compelling patient and yearns to know him better. She's instrumental in saving his life but cannot keep him under Carnton's protective wing when soldiers in gray are herded like cattle to Union prison camps.

Franklin's rural residents, some in abject poverty and others in comfortable homesteads, provide a colorful panorama of lives affected by civil war. Side plots involve townspeople whose lives will change forever. The grieving widow takes strength from the men who have resided within her house, however short their time. Carnton's halls are filled with activity, then abruptly emptied. But she cannot forget those who died at Carnton. She begins a correspondence with families of the dead to provide relatives with knowledge about boys they've lost, eventually leading to their reburial on her land. She wears black in memory of them all.

Hicks's chapters are laid out much the same as those written by Jeff Shaara in his compelling Civil War books. Sections are titled by characters whose points of view are explored within, or by dates that story actual wartime timelines. Some are written in first person, others in third person, but the book flows forward in an easy read that catches readers' attention throughout.

Will Baylor, Franklin's elitist businessman, is a stubborn anti-war zealot who sacrifices his only son rather than accept the boy's passion for the cause. In addition, the son has dared to fall in love with a girl whose family lives in poverty. Baylor's whims affect the fates of the entire populace, ultimately changing the stance that Carrie takes against him.

THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH is the product of Hicks's research about Franklin, in particular the restoration of the Carnton plantation as a historical site, home to the cemetery Carrie McGavock built to honor the thousands of dead who lost their lives at Franklin, Tennessee. Relationships between Carrie, husband John, Mariah and her son Eli, and Zachariah Cashwell are fictional, but the reality of the battle and the losses sustained by the Confederacy are fact. Promotional material compares THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH to the likes of GONE WITH THE WIND and DR. ZHIVAGO. I would not classify Hicks's book with such lofty classics, but I do recommend it as a historical novel with enthralling personalities.

Those are the novels where a reviewer can only attempt to whet the reader's appetite and then simply allow them to discover the richness that exists within. The Widow of the South by Robert Hicks is just such a book.

Hicks has written a fictional account of the true story about the Civil War and Carrie Cradock. In Franklin, Tennessee, Carrie Cradock is mourning the loss of three of her children and is concerned about her husband's safety. The war is raging and Carrie and her slave, Mariah are left to run the plantation.

Canton Plantation, Carrie's home, is turned into a field hospital. During a brutal battle 9,000 Americans died and many others were wounded. The dead were buried on a neighboring plantation. Several years later, when the dead soldiers were in danger of being plowed under by the plantation's owner, Carrie reburied many in her own personal cemetery where she carefully tended the graves.

A wounded soldier, Zachariah Caldwell, is not of Carrie's class, yet he wakes in her feelings she didn't know she had. Their love for each other is not to be. And when they part, it is forever. But forever is not always the way life turns out. As an old woman, tending to her graves, the wounded soldier returns to ask a question.

Hicks has written a compelling, poignant and touching story of a woman whose circumstances shapes the person she will become. The characters are richly drawn and the disaster of war so real, it is frightening. In The Widow of the South, Hicks recreated a tragedy of American History that should not be forgotten.

McGavock is a well-known name around Nashville, which added to my interest.  I eagerly picked this book up and dived in, prepared to meet the main characters and learn more about the battle and its aftermath, and previous reviews made the book that much more appealing.  However, as I read, I found myself disappointed in the actual retelling of the battle itself; I was hoping for more action and deeper characterizations.  The plot meanders between points of view and Carrie McGavock's motivations are particularly difficult to understand.  On a personal level, I could delve into her darkness of depression over the loss of her children, but since it was a common occurrence in the mid 1800s, I found it a bit over-the-top.  Her feelings for Zachariah are not in character and are never believable.  Mariah is a strong character who never achieves her own voice and a few of the side stories seem forced as well.  The novel finally achieves its goals in the last 100 pages as the focus for Carrie becomes clear and her determination shows.

This is the story of how a Confederate graveyard came to be on the plantation grounds of Crofton in the Town of Franklin after the brutal battle there.  According to the historical note at the end of the book (which is very interesting) the novel is based upon the true story of ""Miss Carrie"", the dame of the plantation whose home is taken as a hospital for the battle and her subsequent efforts to protect the buried of bodies of the Confederate dead buried on the battlefield immediately after the bloodbath.

The initial scenes of the house as a hospital, Carrie's work and the interest taken in her by one of the wounded Arkansans is eerily similar to the plot of Bahr's ""The Black Flower"".  At this point the book is still good and the characters, who tell their stories in brief chapters are still interesting.

Within days of the battle and the amputation of the Arkansan's leg, the plot falls off.  There is what, I guess, could be called a love story that developes between Carrie and the soldier.  The chapters get longer as if the author was not quite sure where to take the yarn as opposed to the earlier short crisp narratives.

Once the soldier leaves there are some descriptions of his life that are totally irrelevant and add nothing to the novel.  He returns to Franklin, and there is not much to his return either.

I got the impression that the author knew the history of: a) Carrie's work in the hospital, then b) securing the bodies from the battlefield for her cemetery and last, c) running the cemetery.  However, he floundered getting from point a) to point b) so he manufactured this infatuation or love story.  It never seemed to have a point, meandered tediously and, ironically, it seemed to make the characters less sympathetic than they were before.  Carrie's husband was left out in left field throughout.  His character never to made any sense.  Two slaves who became free could have been wonderful cast members but were never developed.

The book was effective in relating the brutality of the Battle of Franklin and its aftermath.  The author was correct in his historical note that the story of Carrie, her manse and the graveyard are interesting.  However, the love story did not enhance the telling.  The Black Flower is a far better depiction of the Battle of Franklin and its hospital.  And, without a note, it apparently included a character based upon Carrie.  Bahr's ""Year of Jubilo"" is a better depiction of Franklin after the war.",Promising Start,1127865600,,

She felt it would have been an excellent non-fiction title (based on the true story of Carrie McGavock).

As fiction though, she dismisses it as ""an overwrought, overwritten novel that misses conveying the war's terrible reality and the courage of one woman.""

Its a real mess, so I just wanted to make a note of it to help avoid confusion. This review is for KILLING FEAR...

Seven years ago, Theodore Glenn was convicted of murdering four women and vowed revenge against those he held responsible for his incarceration. After a natural disaster occurs at San Quentin prison where he's being held, he escapes and heads south to begin his killing spree. Robin McKenna is a former stripper, current business owner, and the woman whose testimony helped put Glenn behind bars. Her ex-lover, Detective Will Hooper was the arresting officer, and both are on the top of this vicious and manipulative killer's hit list.

First off, though this is book one in the Prison Break Trilogy, Ms. Brennan puts a lot of cross-over characters into her novels. Will Hooper actually made multiple appearances in the No Evil Trilogy, and for that reason I'd suggest reading 'Speak No Evil' first, which is his partner's story. Even better, I'd recommend reading all her stories chronologically since each one is thrilling in its own right and there are so many people you'll recognize from previous books. No worries though if you'd prefer not to, as this can definitely be read as a standalone.

Killing Fear was a thrilling read which immediately grabbed my attention. At the start of this story I had a super hard time putting it down and figured it was a a five-star book for sure. However, although it was fast paced and never boring, I never really felt connected to either Will or Robin's characters. Glenn on the other hand, was a truly chilling individual whose obsession with Robin gave me the creeps. In the end I thought it was a very compelling romantic suspense, one I'm happy to have read and would easily recommend.",KILLING FEAR - Prison Break Trilogy Book 1,1471132800,,
5.0,False,"07 26, 2016",AAKO4YAM9BZE5,B000FCKPG2,,Angie Mike,"Although this is the second book in Ms. Brennan's No Evil Trilogy and the story line can completely stand alone, because of all the connecting characters I'd highly recommend reading the series in order: (1) Speak No Evil (2) See No Evil (3) Fear No Evil

When San Diego's assistant district attorney, Julia Chandler, learns her niece is suspected of murdering her stepfather, she's determined to do any and everything she can to prove her innocence. To that end she hires private eye Connor Kincaid, the man who helped Emily once before but who blames Julia for losing his job as a police officer. Working together they discover a string of murders, all connecting to an online therapy group. Just when Julia and Connor think they've figured it out there's another murder which proves otherwise. Julia however has been asking too many questions and making someone nervous. If they can't uncover the truth soon, she may be this twisted group's next chosen victim.

This book started out good but by the halfway point I hated whenever I was forced to put it down. Early on I thought I had the instigator figured out but I was wrong and I never did suspect who was leading this group of young killers. The plot was utterly unpredictable and had a lot going on which constantly kept me on my toes. I loved both Julia and Connor who had some history and hard feelings, but who also had an undeniable connection. Their chemistry and passion was breathtaking and I absolutely adored them as a couple. Getting into the minds of these young killers was frightening and often gruesome too.

4.0,True,"06 5, 2016",AAKO4YAM9BZE5,B000FCKPG2,,Angie Mike,"Well, this was an emotionally engaging read although it was my least favorite of the trilogy. That's entirely due to the subject matter though which revolves around the kidnapping, rape and murder of 9-11 year old little girls. Needless to say, as a mother and aunt I had a difficult time dealing with some of the scenes. However, the writing was excellent as always, and had me bawling on a couple of occasions. This is the third and last in a series and can absolutely standalone, but I'd highly recommend 'The Prey' and most especially 'The Hunt' since the couple from that story play a large part in this one. I liked Zack and Olivia, though I had a harder time connecting with her character because of the aloofness she projected. The romance didn't seem to truly take root until the final quarter of the story, but I wound up really loving them as a couple. The ending was satisfying and although the serial child murderer gets his just reward, I felt a little conflicted over how it came about.

5.0,True,"12 29, 2015",A3A8ZWT0B8C91T,B000FCKPG2,,Turtledog223,"This is my 13th Allison Brennan book having read all four trilogies and one stand alone. I have to admit that when I began this book, I became worried I wouldn't like it and that I was going to be offended as it starts out with characters who are extreme activists for animal and environmental rights and do violent, illegal things. I even skipped to the acknowledgments to see if Ms. Brennan had thanked anyone involved with animal or environmental rights and whether she had sought out their perspective. I didn't see that and that made me even more worried how this book would portray an issue I care deeply about - I am an animal rights activist and like most activists, believe in non-violence for all beings. But I continued on and was relieved to find that the story geared away from that and focused more on extremists with psychopathy.

The plot was good though not as exciting as previous books. This one was a bit more predictable but I still enjoyed the main character, Nora, and getting to know Duke Rogan. If I had to rank the books I've read so far, this one would fall at the bottom but I would be the first to say (as I wrote) that I am biased and that may be a factor. I think it would have been nice to have it clarified that the majority of people who believe that animals should not be killed for unnecessary things like food or clothing (and yes, even medical research) are not crazy or extreme but compassionate. I wasn't happy that the bio-tech researchers who keep innocent animals in captivity and make them sick and suffer were presented in a more favorable light than those who see the unfairness of that and believe that all life matters.

For people who are not sensitive to these issues, I think the book would be as well received as any of her others. I have given this book five stars because I can separate my personal feelings about the subject matter from the quality of the writing, which in Allison Brennan's case is always excellent.

The hardest thing about finishing a book you love is saying goodbye to the characters. Thankfully, that's not a big issue with Allison Brennan's books because they continue to turn up in future books. It allows you a peek into how their lives keep progressing past their own book. I'm especially happy when member of the Kincaide family pop up as well as Hans Vigo, the FBI profiler. I'm really hoping he gets his own book soon with his true love story. He may be older but love knows no age, right? Speaking of age, I'm also happy that the main characters  in these books are not all 22 but in their 30's and 40's.

As this is my seventh book that I've read by this author, it's happened to me seven times. One of the things I love most about Ms. Brennan's series is getting to have recurring characters in each of the books. I've really come to love the entire Kincaid clan as well as all the peripheral characters such as Will Hooper, Jim Gage, etc. who each get to be the main focus of a novel.

Another thing I love is that while each book has a romance, it doesn't detract from the mystery aspect of the book. It's the best of both worlds. ""Killing Fear"" is highly suspenseful, emotional and well-written. Ms. Brennan always does an excellent job creating antagonists who have complex, psychological layers that ring very true. She does malignant narcissism very well indeed.

You're so in love with this woman (after all, he says he loves her about a thousand times with no response, which after awhile, just becomes pathetic) yet you stay away from her for 7 years, screwing every woman you can?  Then there's the fact that Will's character just didn't match what we've seen of him in other books.  He was a bumbling fool in this book.  And Robin?  Well, she was an immature bitch, and by chapter 40, she deserved to die for being such a weak, spineless idiot.  The plot was so-so, and the plot twist of two different murderers was unnecessary and distracting.  I've wasted a lot of money on this author.  Don't make the same mistake.

P.S. And the continuing saga of Patrick being in a coma---now for 8 months---goes on.  That whole issue makes no sense unless it's some build up for his own book, which I have yet to see published.",Another dud,1379721600,,

This one I might give 2 1/2 stars to just because there was just way too much going on, too many suspects involved, too many intertwined characters, and I just couldn't be bothered to try to keep it all straight.  The romance aspect was fairly decent, but I hate the whole misunderstanding-from-the-past thing they had going.  Harkens back to my days watching soap operas.

There was no past between these 2 like in book 2, which to me, just distracts from the main storyline.  True, Olivia was a bit annoying at times, but in my opinion, less so than the female leads in the other 2 books.  The plot, while disturbing, was fairly decent in terms of holding my interest.  I bought this trilogy because a character from the second book is the male lead in the first book of her next trilogy and I wanted his backstory before starting that trilogy.

Allison Brennan: 5.00:
A favorite author.  Like her writing style, her voice, the way she weaves romance into her gripping suspense stories.

See No Evil: 5.00:
Four sentences in this book struck a very personal chord, thus it became a very engrossing, moving, heart-felt story.

 ""I should have fought harder for custody.  But I'm just her aunt.  I know the law.  It was stacked against me.""  (Julia, page 59)

Hero: 4.0:
Connor Kincaid: It was impossible not to feel drawn to this rule-breaking, hot-blooded, hunk of a man who was described as ""a pit bull when he cared about something.""  By the end of the book, Connor had resolved the issues tied to his bitterness that overwhelmed him because he had to resign from a job he loved (San Diego Police Department) when he was forced to testify against his brothers in blue.

Heroine: 4.5:
Julia Chandler: A gorgeous deputy district attorney with a take-no-prisoners reputation, who fought for what she believed in.  It was impossible not to admire a heroine who would not back down -- to anyone.  But . . . she was willing to break the law to save her niece.

Story Line: 4.5:
A uniquely fascinating tale about a villain with a God complex, who manipulated four emotionally wounded teens to kill so he could wreck vengeance without getting his own hands bloody.  When Julia's niece, Emily, was suspected of killing her abusive stepfather, Judge Victor Montgomery, she called Connor, a private investigator, to prove Emily's innocence -- even though she was instrumental in the destruction of his career five years ago.

Action: 4.0:
The story line moved at a fast pace as the villain moved the teens around his chess board and Julia, Connor, Dillon, and Will investigated the deaths that were the result of an e-group called Wishlist.

Emotion: 4.0:
Although not as intense as expected because of the way Brennan drew me into this story, it was impossible not to feel sympathy and compassion for so many of the characters; namely, {1} Connor, {2} Julia, {3} Emily, and, surprisingly, {4} Faye.

Romance: 4.0:
There was a stronger feeling of romance in this book than in Brennan's previous four.  Brennan had a kiss that Connor and Julia shared five years before with which to work.  The fireworks between Connor and Julia bespoke of strong feelings that could not be suppressed.

Sensuous: 3.5:
Lots of sizzle, heat, and sensuality were present when Connor and Julia made love.

Suspense: 5.0:
Brennan is a master when it comes to developing a story that keeps readers on the edge of their seats as they try to figure out who the villain might be -- right along with the main characters.

Secondary Characters:  5.0:
The secondary characters ranged from rich, well-developed characters to barely-there members, but they added great depth to this story.  Liked the continued inclusion of the Kincaid family by including: {1} Dillon Kincaid (the psychiatrist), {2} Patrick Kincaid (the e-crimes guru), {3} homicide detective Will Hooper (an honorary Kincaid), and {4} District Attorney Andrew Stanton (the ex-brother-in-law).  The villains all added to the rich suspenseful flavor necessary for this story: {1} the number one villain (even though he remained unidentified), {2} the co-villain (who also remained unidentified), {3} Faye Kessler, the most heart-breaking teen villain, {4} Camilla ""Cami"" Wohler, the most cold-blooded teen villain, {5} Dennis ""Skip"" Richardson, Jr., a minor teen villain, and {6} Robert ""Robbie"" Haxton, the other minor teen villain.  Julia's relatives were necessary additions: {1} Emily Chandler Montgomery, her niece, and {2} Crystal Montgomery, Emily's mother (the gold-digger).  And, last, but definitely not least were two intriguing additions: {1} Selene Borge and {2} Billy Thompson.

The Kill: 4.85:
An un-put-down-able, re-read-able book because: {1} Allison Brennan is a favorite author; {2} Romantic Suspense is a favorite sub-genre; and {3} Brennan is a very talented storyteller who can quickly draw her readers into a romantic and suspenseful story and keep their interest all the way through the book.  Except that this story went on a bit too long after the exciting 'this should have been the big finale' scene.

Hero: 4.0:
Zack Thomas: A Seattle Homicide Detective who is sexy, protective, caring, confident, determined and every romance reader's dream come true:

. . . . . If there was one thing Zack Travis knew, it was women.  When to touch.  Where to touch.  How to touch.  (page 79) . . . . .

Heroine: 4.5:
Olivia St. Martin: The strong-willed, intelligent director of Trace Evidence and Materials Analysis at FBI's Virginia-based laboratory who hides her compassion, obsession, and determination behind a faade of ice.  It was easy to identify with Olivia and understand her emotional angst.

Story Line: 5.0:
What an exciting premise around which to revolve a story.  A little girl loses her big sister to a killer and from that moment on her life is never the same.  Through science, she is driven to find justice for all victims of crime.  When she finds out she helped incarcerate an innocent man for killing her sister, she stops at nothing to find the actual killer.  She poses as an FBI Agent to insert herself into the Seattle Police Department's investigation of a serial killer -- believing him to be the man who killed her sister.

Action: 4.0:
The story begins to soar as Zack and Olivia head up the investigation into The Seattle Slayer.  The action in this book, however, is more in the line of police procedural events than exciting adventurous scenes such as car chases and the like.

Emotion: 4.7:
Brennan is amazing as she weaves such deep emotion into a story about a monster.  The emotion in this story is rich for several reasons. {1} Who cannot help but hate a serial killer who rapes and kills little girls?  {2} Brennan richly details the devastation that the families of the slain girls experience -- concentrating on Olivia's crumbling steel walls of control.

Romance: 4.5:
The awareness that arched between Zack and Olivia was never left in doubt.  Zack was attracted to Olivia in spite of the ""don't touch"" signals she broadcast.  Olivia's walls of emotional protection began to collapse and a deep romantic connection built as she spent more time with Zack.

Sensuous: 3.0:
Brennan knows how to include spice, heat, passion and emotion in her love scenes.

Suspense: 4.0:
The suspense was constant and became more intense as the story progressed.  Brennan painted such a complex, controlled, astute picture of The Seattle Slayer and his ability to evade detection, that she had readers wondering how Zack, Olivia and their team were going to catch this slippery predator.

Secondary Characters: 4.5:
Brennan seems to really get into the heads of her supporting characters.  She did a phenomenal job of making both The Seattle Slayer (the true villain) and Brian Harrison Hall (the circumstantial villain) very multi-faceted.  Although not as well developed as these two men, the other supporting characters in the book came to life with concise descriptions and minimal appearances.  It was nice to get a picture of Quinn and Miranda Peterson's future when they were included in the story.

He's deadly. And he doesn't know what the hell to do with FBI Agent Megan Elliott. Well, besides fall in love with her.

I listened to the audio version and at first thought that it was a little awkward listening to the narrator, Ann Marie Lee, for the character that she was playing. However, once I got into listening to the story, it didn't seem to bother me, it just struck me as odd at first. I think the narrator did the story great justice.

As for the characters, I felt like they were in depth and to the core. I was interested in reading about them and learning more about them as the story progressed. I felt like all the characters blended together nicely to create a great story.

I thought that the storyline ran smoothly without any delay. I really enjoyed the romance with a serious mystery. The romance part was not overdone, but a perfect fit with the story just to give it that extra spice.

Yes, there is a mystery.  Yes, this is Duke Rogan's story.  Was I disappoointed?  Yes!!!  First of all the story starts out twenty yrs ago with a couple of revolutionaries who were blowing up buildings.  The daughter turns her mom and stepdad into the FBI.  The daughter, Nora, falls in love with her FBI contact, who is murdered by her stepdad.  Her mom is sent to prison and Nora and her sister to child services.  Now twenty years later she is an FBI Agent and her sister Quin is a Fire Marshall.

Once again terrorists are targeting Biotech firms.  The latest one is protected by Duke Rogan's security.  There is a body this time and it is the owner of the firm who was a friend of Duke's.  Duke is immediately attracted to Nora, but although she likes him she clings to the memory of Andy from 20 years ago.

3.0,True,"04 1, 2009",ABXZMKZUIVBTI,B000FCKPG2,,The Lindsay Show,"I generally love Allison Brennan and while her books are never heavy on the romance, this book held almost no romance. For at least the first 1/3 of the book Jack and Megan don't even have any interactions with each other. When they finally meet it's instant attraction and jumping into headlong into a full blown relationship. I don't have a problem with that sort of quick falling in love, but in this book it seemed like an after thought thrown in there with little development. Even after Jack and Megan meeting and instantly fall in love there isn't enough interactions between the 2 to really draw me into the story.

As a straight novel of suspense, it was good. I gave it 3 stars for a few reasons though:

1. I really was expecting more romance if this was going to be marketed as a romantic suspense
2. The extensive, graphic attention devoted to the torture of the victims and the sexual pleasure the killers get from the torture was disturbing. I don't mind some torture scenes but Brennan described in great detail multiple torture scenes to the point where it finally made me uncomfortable and I started skipping the scenes devoted to the killers.
3. I understand that giving insight into the killers is a great device when telling a good mystery/suspense novel but I felt she gave too much attention to the killers. Some of the scenes felt repetitive and too detailed. Maybe I feel that way because I don't normally read strict suspense novels, but I would have liked it more if there were less pages on the killers and more on the development of Jack and Megan's relationship.
4. The conflict between Hans and Megan seemed forced and could have been developed better I think.

If you go into this novel understanding you're not getting much romance and that there's graphic, at times disturbing scenes of torture, then you'll probably like this book more than I did.

This was labeled as romantic suspense, and the mislabeling is what bothers me the most.  In my opinion, it does not have enough romance or development of a relationship to qualify for that genre.  This is mostly mystery suspense with a lot of uncomfortable torture scenes.  95% of the story is about the authorities finding clues and slowly unraveling the mystery about serial killings.  The small amount of romance consists of a couple meeting, working together on the case, and getting together at the end.  I didn't get the feelings of anticipation or enjoyment that I normally expect from ""romance"" novels.  Once in a while I will enjoy a straight mystery because the characters pull me in, or the dialogue is interesting, or I feel good while reading it.  But this book didn't have those effects on me.  I think mystery lovers will like this more than I did.

I had a minor problem with the smart good guys doing a couple of stupid or illogical things.  Megan was stupid and careless toward the end which caused a major problem.  Hans was angry at Megan for reasons I felt did not make sense or fit with his character.

STORY BRIEF:
Megan is a by-the-book FBI agent investigating veterans who had been tortured and killed.  Jack is a former veteran and now a soldier-for-hire.  He joins with Megan to find the killers after his best friend is killed (one of the victims).  We learn early in the story who the killers are (Ethan and Karin) so I'm not giving anything away.  Ethan was with a group of soldiers in Afghanistan.  He was captured and tortured for three months by the Taliban before being rescued.  He is suicidal and loaded with mental problems.  Karin wants to learn torture techniques, but Ethan won't teach her.  Therefore she convinces Ethan that he needs to capture and torture the veterans who were with him at the time, saying they abandoned him.  She plans and helps him capture the vets, and then learns by watching Ethan stick needles into them.  The main mystery is finding the killers, but a second mystery is why Karin wants to learn to torture.

Julia and Chandler have a history and it's not a happy one since it centers on the time when he resigned from the police force. But Julia's niece, Emily, is in trouble and Conner has helped out before as a private eye to help find Emily and Julia needs him now since Emily's stepfather has been murdered and Emily looks like the prime suspect.

Julia, Conner and Conner's brother Dillon work together to sort out some strange happenings in their area and track down the killers to help prove Emily's innocence. On the way to that end, Julia and Conner have to work through their feelings from the past and the feelings that they are currently feeling.

Loaded with suspense with a side of romance, plus characters you really like, See No Evil is a great read from start to finish. EAch time I set this book down, I couldn't wait until I could pick it up next and see what Julia and Conner would do. The mystery is intricately woven and very enjoyable to try and figure out. The crimes and the subject matter are dark and handled very realistically but you don't feel bogged down by the whole plot.

The story surrounds a beautiful DA Julia who must prove her niece's innocence after her stepfather is found horribly murdered in his study. A stepfather whom the niece was being molested by & had plenty of motive to kill. There to help is a figure from Julia's past who holds a grudge and a lot of lust against her, Connor Kinkaid. Moving in the background however is a mysterious group of youths who will stop at nothing to keep their plan moving, even as their shadowy leader pulls their strings.

This story had so many flaws to it. First off, the characters were interesting in theory, but I just couldn't find myself really getting into the main characters. Connor was fine, but Julia just seemed lackluster. The most interesting characters were the ones never fully explored. The other major flaw is the lack of buildup for who the leader is, why he wanted so many people dead, & how he discovered everyone and pulled them together. His real identity isn't even introduced until the last part of the book & didn't really fit with the story. (He showed up before then, but only as the villain. His persona wasn't introduced or anything until the last part of the book.)

For that matter, the reasons & wherefores for the rest of the kids aren't ever really explained either. We're *told* that they're all angsty rich kids who were abused (small spoiler, but not really), but it just never seems enough to really explain why they'd do any of that. In the end Brennan goes for the old standard of ""They're crazy, so that's their reasoning"". When we finally *do* get the reasons why, they're so farfetched & unsubstantiated that I found it hard to think of it as a real reason or find it very shocking. There just wasn't any buildup for those revelations, so the ending fell flat. While many would find this entertaining enough to keep them occupied, there's just not enough for me to recommend it as a ""must read"". This is the type of book you pick up when there's nothing else there at the thrift store, not new off the shelves.

Carina Kincaid's partner is Will Hooper, seven yrs ago Will was on the task force that caught and put Theodore Glenn in prison on death row. During the course of the investigation Will met and fell in love with Robin McKenna.  She was one of the strippers at RJ's, Theodore glenn killed four other strippers who were her friends before he was caught. The last one was her roommate. Robin found her and has nightmares still, about falling over the body and sliding through the blood.

Will is a detective with the SFPD, he is divorced and has only had short affairs with other women since he lost Robin. Will lost her trust when he didn't believe her about Glenn. She never had an affair with him. Will finds that the news of Glenn's escape brings back all the feelings for Robin and when he sees her, he knows he will do everything he can to protect her and if he is lucky win her back into his arms.

Robin started stripping to pay for college, but every man she has dated has equated stripping with prostitution. She has lost all trust in men until she met Will. She opened her heart to him and thought he trusted her, but his questions about her relationship with Glenn destroyed what trust and love she had for him. Now Robin owns RJ's and it is an uptown night club. Very chic and understated the club has been rebuilt and refurnished while the area was undergoing a rejuvenation. However Robin still sleeps with the lights on.

When an unknown fault causes an earthquake at San Quention, Theodore takes the chance with many others and escapes. He knows he is a genius and has made plans already for a future escape so this just moves up his timetable. Now he intends to finish what he started and that is to kill Robin and all the others who put him in prison.

Her investigation reveals that a serial killer has been on the loose for years. He surfaced in New York several years after Missy's murder and then appeared in Kansas, Atlanta, Nashville and other cities. His twenty-nine victims in thirty-four years were all blonde females between the ages of 9 and 12. Olivia's boss refuses to involve the agency so she travels on her own to Washington State where two of the recent murders occurred.

In Washington she joins Seattle Police Detective Zack Travis' investigation. They begin to work closely together to hunt the killer--and become romantically involved. Time is running out and Olivia struggles to solve the case and prevent more murders.

One big formatting challenge for formatting Kindle editions is that unlike a paper book or periodical, the reader can't readily flip back and forth (sometimes I wish I had two Kindles side by side). The best solution so far is to make sure that there are sufficient hyperlinks for notes, table of contents and anything else one might want to temporarily refer to. The separate Article List and Section Lists can do a pretty good job of this if implemented intelligently.

The WSJ ""Whats News"" listings used to be on Kindle as a separate section, with its own article list that included the first line of an article and each article was hyperlinked. There were duplicate listings of articles under the various section headings, but so what? You could easily find what interested you to read first.

Now the ""What's News"" listings are all under ""Page One"", with the articles listed in a hard to read series as a single paragraph (a bulleted list would at least be some improvement), with no hyperlinks for the individual articles.

Then THAT Page One ""paragraph"" is hyperlinked to where you finally get the original individual article hyperlinks from a headline cum first line listing. This means more clicking, more levels to find what you want. A very counter productive time consuming change. An ""improvement"" it's not.

Bad idea No. 2: The reduction of sections listed in the Kindle ""Section List"" - my preferred default state rather than the article list - no longer includes a ""Letters and Opinion"" Section. Instead the letters and Editorials and Op-Eds are just at the end of the huge continuous ""Page One"" section listing, so you have to page through the whole Page One list to get to the editorial content.

This change is another time-consuming annoyance that also suggests that the new regime at the WSJ doen't understand the basic concept of journalism that ""news/facts/reportage"" and ""editorial/opinon"" content are not the same thing. The old system made it clear what was what, which gave the reader some confidence that the owners, editors and reporters also were clear on the distinction. Bad move, WSJ.

I also second the complaints about the cost: they could at least throw in the web subscription for the price of the Kindle edition, although I do use the WSJ mobile web version with the Kindle browser to get the market data page.

Along with the NYTimes, the WSJ is still one of the better Kindle periodical implementations, but it could have been improved; instead we got the opposite.",Nov 2008 format change not good = 4 stars now not 5,1227830400,12,

Rather than focusing on the epicure wonders of one country, Kelly shoots for the melting-pot American approach of multiculturalism and sails the wine-dark sea in search of a metaphorically food-loving Ithaca.

Unlike Giuliano's vignette-styled success, Kelly takes a foodie's approach:  food snobbery and sheer gastronomical delight reign supreme tempered with gluttonless slow eating and small portion sizes.  Her best tip?  Special treats like a scoop of gelato shouldn't be eaten every day, but when one indulges the three-bite rule should be enforced; delight in only three bites and then stop before excess rules over commonsense.

Kelly's book cruises along tracking other `real food' diet/lifestyle road maps like the ""Sonoma"" and ""Fat Fallacy"" regimes.  If there is a difference its intaglio is the wealth of recipes that Kelly includes from seasonal staple dishes from menus of her famous restaurant composed of fresh ingredients facilitated by Primo's own vegetable and herb gardens.  After explaining her Italian-American rearing on Long Island (you go girl---I am also an Italian American from Old Bethpage), she divides the book into familiar components---forgive my explanatory license here.  Topics like `high flavor', `variety', `olive oil', `the market and garden', `tapas portions', `whole grain', `meat control', `eating at the family table', `water and wine', `eating little but eating well',  `heart healthy', `living a small rural life', provide a glimmer into the svelte world of the archetypical Mediterranean woman with the addition of health factoids and individual stories that are geared to launch the convenience driven American mindset into a landscape resplendent with a cornucopia of good choices and the breathing room to utterly enjoy and savor the options.

Although not your typical diet book replete with dietary dos and don'ts, Kelly does round out her information with a nuts and bolts chapter that answers the obvious questions of how? how much? and when? with a seven day-menu planner that controls portions, includes the wholesome foods discussed in the previous chapters and adds a little meat for a little excitement.

Along with this, she plugs the idea of balance and contentment which seems to embody the Mediterranean woman and calls to mind that relaxed feeling that one gets even after a short two week trip abroad.  Even though she admits that life in America seems very far away from life in the Mediterranean, she asserts that she ""almost [has] it right"" bolstering her opinion with Charlotte Cushman's words ""To try to be better is to be better.""

Kelly's chatty style reflects the ease she employs to welcome us into her quasi-Mediterranean world.  At times her enthusiasm runs amok and she falls into the same annoying foreign language usage utilized by Mireille Giuliano in FWDGF.  Overtly, Mireille shamelessly uses her `French-ness' to charm her super-sized American audience; sadly Kelly's pseudo sophistication runs the foreign phrase gamut using too-cutesy italicized comments from Gibraltar to Lebanon that annoy rather than instruct and detract from otherwise good information.

Bottom line?  While Melissa Kelly's all-American pluralistic approach in ""Mediterranean Women Stay Slim, Too"" works well on the level of providing good information and interesting recipes, it seems that the current marketplace is saturated with so many books advocating real food and slow eating that they all seem to cover the same ground.  Under the guise of learning the newest need-to-know slenderizing secrets of different cultures, we learn only a few simple facts:  Eat well, eat slowly and enjoy life.  Recommended to those who would appreciate some staple Mediterranean recipes.

But the book annoyed me, too. Mayes seemed hypercritical, judgmental off-and-on about her accomodations and her meals. She jumped around while describing her setting so that I felt like I was looking at her world through the eye of a jerky video camera. Yet she also wrote poetically at times, describing foods she ate and places she visited so beautifully that I felt I'd eaten, too, that I'd travelled with her. The last chapter is a wonderful summing up of the need to travel that could equally well apply to the need to read as well. Mayes reminds us of T.S.

I bought the book the day it came out. I'm finished reading it now, months later. As with a few of the other reviewers, I found it very difficult to get through it. The first half was mostly food reviews and discourses. I was hoping for the wit and one sentence capturing of people and places that she used in her previous books. Not much of what she wrote made me want to visit Portugal, Spain, Naples, Fez and Burgundy. I too was a bit appalled by her lack of understanding for her fellow passengers on the Greek cruise. She had a free trip and basically denigrated the experience. Cruises aren't for everyone, but hey, most of us wouldn't turn down a free one and would try and find the best parts of the experience rather than wallowing in the worst.

It wasn't until she hit the British Isles that her obsession with food lessened and she became the writer I loved from Under the Tuscan Sun. I did question some of her reviews of British food. I have rarely eaten anything to rave about in England, Scotland and Ireland. It is good solid food and enjoyable, but not something to send one to lala land over the taste and texture and experience. She also managed to bring the beauty of the gardens that the UK is so famous for to me through her words. That redeemed the poorly presented first half of the book in my eyes!

In the preface she says that she and Ed quit their jobs to write and to explore new possibilities (which includes travel). I do hope future books are a little more rounded. I know that this is more of a memoir than a travelogue in many ways, but it would have been nice to have had a more cohesive picture of the country they were currently visiting rather than constant descriptions of hanging sheep heads and the way to cook them. For me at least, the lyrical beauty of food in her Tuscan books, was just not there for me in this one. Sometimes her descriptions of the places she and Ed were visiting seemed thrown in beside the wonders of their culinary adventures. She obviously feels that understanding the foods and wines/drinks of a place are important to understanding the culture. It just would have been nice if there had been more culture, more people, more descriptions of places than of vegetables and the quest for a perfect espresso.

And all this talk of food makes me wonder why she and Ed aren't at least 300 pounds! I've seen Ms. Mayes at a book fair and she is not overweight and not slender model size--just normal.

The whole idea of ""feeling at home"" suggests that an individual needs to discover the in-depth reality of the people, culture and everyday life experiences of each destination. What fun Mayes has as she processes each experience with wonder.

Delving into the history, along with looking through the eyes of poets and writers from these places, she experiences a bit of the past and present.

Mayes would make a wonderful food critic, as her description of the large variety of cuisine she experienced makes drooling from the reader a possibility. The tapas tasted throughout Italy, rissoles in Lisbon or food passed around on the flight to Naples is a gourmet experience for the reader.

Whether Mayes and her husband stay in castles, rented houses, hotels, monasteries, homes of people or are cruising to their destination, the delightful experience is thoroughly shared with the reader. It's fun to share in the shopping experiences and see what souvenirs Mayes picks up in different markets and the reasons she and her husband want the items. Treasures they find include a five-pound book from a museum in Madrid, CD of flamenco music in Sevilla, different foods or seasonings, tiles and animal skins.

With this one, I read the first two chapters and found myself looking for the index to see if I could find anything I found to be more interesting.

I was able to read most of the book, but had to put it down in between each chapter.

That being said, there are some wonderful portions of the book.  I particularly enjoyed the section on Scotland and her chapters on Italy were up to her usual standards.

Author Frances Mayes achieved a universal sense of liberation and self-acceptance with her most famous book, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", but despite her immense gift in conveying  the images of foreign cultures, she falls a bit short with her latest collection of essays. Timing also works against her as fellow writer Elizabeth Gilbert has recently come out with her own revealing diary of a year traveling abroad with ""Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"".

Whereas Gilbert undergoes a cathartic experience that transforms her from an urban-dwelling workaholic, Mayes - having already experienced her own catharsis in refurbishing a 900-year old Tuscan villa - already seems well prepared for the pleasures and hazards of travel and often comes across as a dilettante in the way she and her husband Ed hopscotch the globe in search of a feeling of home all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Giving up the security of their tenured university positions, the couple covers quite a bit of ground, and in fact, each chapter represents a unique locale and consequently an idiosyncratic experience. As if hosting a travel series, they go to museums that range from the world-renowned Prado in Madrid to a Welsh museum filled with over one thousand teapots. In a less adventurous vein than Anthony Bourdain, they also dine on the local cuisine whether it is churros in Sevilla or Sally Lunn bread in the Cotswolds or Ed's constant quest for the perfect espresso. Academics at heart, they immerse themselves into the local literature to ensure they are not ignorant before coming to landmarks of historical or cultural significance.

However, as with Gilbert's book, the best passages in Mayes' book have to do with the local people that she and Ed meet and get to know. Mayes has a particular talent in describing unique characters like the aggressive, multilingual Istanbul rug dealer who sends notes in miniature looms or the Fez tour guide who loves to quote from Joseph Conrad. These are the people that bring the book to life. Frances and Ed, on the other hand, seem like observers, thoughtful tour guides for the upscale traveler. The author seems to be taking a page from Alain de Botton's ""The Art of Travel"" where he waxes fondly on the multitude of epiphanies brought about by one's own voyaging and mixing the resulting experiences with observations made by the great artists and writers. I just think Mayes doesn't quite elucidate those epiphanies at a meaningful enough level given the hodgepodge approach of their journey.",Under the Tuscan Shadow Lies a Hopscotch Tour of Europe and the Mediterranean,1142899200,,

It focuses on a 38 year old woman aptly named Jane Fortune, a female who has become rather set in her ways, losing hope of ever finding love, let alone true happiness. Her life is rather lackluster. How and why will she change? Or will she? That is the main issue but the various subplots are what make this book a special treat. Horowitz throws in little gems of insight, much as Austen did. This book will make you think about society's conventions - or perhaps make you wonder about the loss of them.

  The author of this book, Laurie Horowitz, includes a special section where she explains how she came to write the book and why she deviated from the conventions of Austen novels. Basically, she has created a thoughtful, compelling book which takes into account the way society has changed since Austen's time - women actually work outside the home, they may be more independent, etc.

  What I found intriguing was how Horowitz managed to have a strong, independent female (Jane Fortune) at the heart of this book while still maintaining the mannered tone of an Austen novel, quite a feat to pull off. She does this by setting her tale in Boston, a city which still has its share of people who care about social class. She shows the subtle distinctions between those with old money and those who are newly wealthy, but does so with taste and a deft touch. Jane Fortune is one of those who come from old-money aristocracy but who is feeling more and more out of date, feeling that managing a trust fund and the family foundation may not be her life's goal. Her ""charmed life"" is beginning to feel more and more like a cage and not the Eden it used to be. She also misses the love of her life (who, thank goodness, is about to appear again).

  I found Jane Fortune to be compelling, although some readers might find her reserved, haughty and a bit too judgmental. For me, however, she had a keen eye, a willingness to face her weaknesses and (usually) the good sense to bite her tongue for the sake of peace. Mostly, though, I savored this book for the similarities to Austen, with just enough difference to hold my interest.",Jane Austen's Persuasion updated - a delight!,1180656000,,

Yes, its numbered as one, but from my understanding, the author went back and wrote this farther into the series, although I have no idea how far in she was when she wrote it. I guess that means when I read book 2 first, out of order(I thought), I was really reading the first one that came out? Confusing yes, but it doesnt even matter as I think any of these can be read as a standalone if need be.

Greg Hewitt is working late at his office where he is a psychologist. When he leaves, he finds himself climbing into the trunk of a car even though all he is thinking about is his upcoming vacation. Quite the beginning! Lissianna Argeneau arrives at her mothers home for her birthday party and makes a quick stop in her old bedroom. There she finds her birthday present tied to her bed. And that is a very abbreviated version of how the hero and heroine of this book meet.

Lissianna is part of the huge Argeneau family of vampires, based in Toronto. Shes smart, caring, and a good person. She is a social worker for a homeless shelter and really cares for the people there. Shes actually very human with the exception of what makes her a vampire. She is a born vampire and has never been dead. Theres actually a very creative back story for these vampires and how they came to be. These aren't your normal bloodthirsty devils or even the glittery kind. At over two hundred years old, she still looks to be about twenty five. Greg is pretty much a workaholic and hasn't taken a vacation in years. Hes around thirty five, handsome, and very intelligent. Lissianna and Greg are immediately attracted to each other, although I still am not sure why Greg isn't fighting desperately to get out of the house. Compelled? Yes, but with a strong mind that they cant keep under control. There is actually a huge cast of characters besides these two. Its a house party weekend for Lissiannas birthday, so we meet a lot of the Argeneau family in this book. My favorite of all was Lissiannas cousin Thomas, probably her closest friend and fellow conspirator in all things fun. If I can find a book with him as a main character, it will probably be my next read in this series. As with any of these books that I have previously read, there is of course, a villain. And I am going to leave it at that.

This was a good romance with a bit of a mystery that morphed into a thriller at times. But most of all, this was just a fun read. Theres humor, good characters, and a bit of steamy romance. As with the previous books, I really enjoyed the world building as well. Did it have a deep intricate plot? Not so much, and that was perfectly alright. I have thoroughly enjoyed myself with every one of these reads and this book was no exception. I could however, tell the difference from this book and the latest of her books that I have read. I think the series has definitely gotten better as it progressed. The recent books are really exciting, almost thriller reads, and this one was a bit more sedate. There is a place for both kinds of reads in a series that is this long, at least I think so.

Highly recommended to adult paranormal romance readers. Dont let the sheer number of these books keep you from reading this series, because you can pretty much start anywhere and keep up easily. A Quick Bite equaled a quick, easy, and fun read for me.",Quick Easy Fun Read!,1493683200,,

Lynsay Sands puts a really cool twist on the idea of vampires. I won't spoil anything, but it's different than most of your traditional vampire books. Not only that, but... TINGLES! The small looks, the not-so-casual touches... this book was full of tingles. Some of the scenes were downright HOT!

This is a complete book with no pesky cliffhanger and a HEA. I have to say, I'm definitely a fan. I'm going to definitely pick up the next book in the series. For fans of Paranormal Romance, this book is a must read!

2.0,False,"11 11, 2016",A2EU9VP0MRMUGE,B000GCFWXW,,Sarah (Feeling Fictional),"Lissianna has an unusual problem for a vampire - she faints at the sight of blood! As you can imagine that makes life extremely difficult for her and her family are all worried about how hard it is for her to feed. Her mother decides to take matters into her own hands and she kidnaps a psychologist who specialises in phobias so that he can help Lissianna get over her fears. Things start to go wrong when Lissianna wrongly assumes that Greg is her dinner rather than her doctor but surely one quick bite isn't going to do any harm?

I've been wanting to try the Argeneau series for such a long time now so when I was offered a review copy of A Quick Bite I was really excited and couldn't wait to get started. I'm a huge paranormal romance fan, it's one of my go to genres and I'll never get tired of reading about vampires and other creatures that go bump in the night. I picked this up expecting a fairly light and funny read along the lines of Katie MacAlister's Dark Ones series and I have to say for the first couple of chapters I thought that was exactly what I had got but unfortunately the humour got old very fast and I ended up hating most of the characters.

Lissianna is a 200 year old vampire but along with her cousins (some of whom are even older than she is!) she acts like a 12 year old tween most of the time. They were all just so incredibly childish that it was hard to take any of them seriously and I ended up getting really annoyed with all of them. The way they all kept spying on Lissianna and Greg was just creepy and so was the way everyone could read his mind and know that he was constantly thinking how hot she was. I just got very tired of all the erection jokes! On the subject of Greg I thought is reactions to the situation he found himself in were completely unbelievable. He wakes up in a strange house tied to the bed after arriving in very unusual circumstances yet he's more interested in the thought of being the beautiful stranger's willing sex slave than he is about trying to escape. We get told a lot about how attracted they are to each other but if I'm honest I just didn't feel the chemistry between them, it all felt very clinical and there wasn't enough of a build up for me to feel invested in their relationship.

Although this story is mainly focused on the romance there was also a bit of a suspense plot in the background with someone attempting to murder Lissianna. That could have added something to the book and made it much more interesting apart from the fact that a five year old would have been able to tell you who was behind the attempt pretty much the first time we met their character. It was so completely obvious that the perpetrator might as well have been walking around with ""I'm a Vampire Hunter"" tattooed across their forehead yet Lissianna didn't once think to question their weird behaviour. To put it politely Lissianna is an idiot, I think this quote says it all:

Lissianna shook her head, thinking it was rather amazing she'd survived to reach two hundred if she'd made many mistakes like that over the years.

Honestly I'm not sure how she made it to 200 either, she made so many stupid mistakes when it came to feeding that I stopped counting them but I feel like I spent half the book rolling my eyes at her.

I'm just so disappointed that this book didn't work for me because I had such high hopes for it in the beginning. I am kind of tempted to give the next book a try though, first books in a series can always be a bit hit and miss and since this series is still going strong after 24 books have been published there must be something good about it. So I may give it a second chance at some point but unfortunately I don't think I'll be in any rush, not when there are so many other books on my TBR pile that I'm actually excited about reading.

I have the majority done but am saving those last few to pull me out of reading slumps. If you haven't read her historicals yet, I suggest giving them a shot in audio. She has great narrators that really bring the characters for life. Back to the book at hand, I don't know why I haven't tried the Argeneau series before now. It may be because I tend to search out urban fantasy series because I like to follow the same couple throughout... but I have run through those and now am going back to the paranormal multi-couple series such as Argeneau, Immortals After Dark, etc.

This book was a little different from other vampy books that I have read and listened to in that our hero was not the fangy one. Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a psychologist that specializes in the treatment of phobias. He seems to be a bit of a workaholic and his sister is constantly setting him up on blind dates. He manages to get out of the latest fix up because he is all set to go on vacation to Cancun, his first vacation in many years. Unfortunately before he can do any relaxing, Greg is spirited away by a female vamp who plans to give him to her daughter as a birthday present!

Our heroine is also unique, Lissianna Argeneau is a 200 y/o vamp who suffers from hemophobia. She faints at the sight of blood. This has made Lissianna largely dependent on her family for feeding. So when she sees great bound to her bed with a bow, she mistakes him for dinner! They couple has an instant connection it seems, and Greg is the first mortal whose mind is closed to Lissianna.

As Greg proves to have a strong will, the vamps are at odds regarding his fate and future. He needs to treat Lissianna's phobia... but danger seems to find them at every turn. This was a light-hearted paranormal. It wasn't a dark fantasy with broody vamps and overly serious characters, but it was entertaining despite being somewhat shallow. I don't mean that in a negative way.

So I liked the story, but I didn't love it. I honestly think it was the beta male thing. I like my vamps to be dark, broody and dominant. Greg is pretty much the opposite of those characteristics. Maybe some of the other Argeneau brothers will tickle my fang fancy... but I will keep reading regardless because I know I am going to be entertained with any book by Lynsay.

Since this was an audio, I feel like I should say something about the narrator. It was a solid performance. Nothing stuck out as good or bad. My mind did wander off a few times that required me to rewind... but that was more about me being busy than the book not holding my interest.

I was interested in one of the newer titles in the series, but I decided to go back and start with the first book in the series. I was excited because as a whole, the series seems to be well praised. And the synopsis of the first book, A Quick Bite, is intriguing and offers a unique story line for a vampire read. But, while I didn't hate the book, I did find myself disappointed with it.

A Quick Bite introduces us to the Argeneau family, but the focus is on Lissianna Argeneau, a hundreds of years old vampire who tends to faint at the sight of blood. Like, how awesome is that? Here we have a vampirea species that needs blood in order to survivethat cant stand even seeing the tiniest drop of blood. How does she combat that? How is she surviving? Its actually quite a humorous set up, and I thoroughly enjoy the idea of a vampire who is afraid of blood.

In an effort to help Lissianna overcome her fear, her mother kidnaps Dr. Gregory Hewitta doctor who specializes in phobiasto give to Lissianna as a birthday present. The only thing is, Lissianna doesnt realize that the hot guy tied to her bed is a birthday present that is NOT there for her tasting pleasure. Who can blame her for wanting to take a quick bite from Gregs delicious-looking neck? Once she finds out that Greg is there to help her overcome her phobia, Lissianna is in shock. Did she just accidentally seduce her doctor? Ummmyeah. And shes also in shock that Greg isn't calm and serene like the people her mother normally compels to bring home. Hes very much aware of the fact that hes been kidnapped, and hes not okay with iteven if there is a sexy, vixen vampire offering him more passion than hes ever felt before.

Lissianna feels so bad about what her mother has done, that she helps Greg escape and takes him back to his home. Yet, somehow, they keep finding themselves together again. Because now Lissianna must protect Greg from her uncle who has the power to turn his brain to mush.

I was honestly so disappointed in the direction this story went. It became more about protecting Greg from a threat that ultimately wasn't a real threata threat that distracted them from the real threat, which was so obvious to me as a reader that I couldn't understand how Lissianna was missing it. She wasn't very intelligent. And Lissiannas phobia was forgotten for a big part of the story, and when it was addressed, it was addressed in a poor and uneventful way. I guess I was just expecting that to be a bigger part of the story, and I don't knowI just wasn't excited by this read. Sure, the sexual chemistry was there, but I was off-put by what felt like a case of insta-love. Furthermore, I felt like Gregs feelings toward having to leave his family if he wanted to be with Lissianna were not complex enough and not realistic. I mean, I know Im reading a paranormal romanceI don't expect it to be realistic, but I do expect it try to aim for some sense of relatability.

The writing was just sub-par, and I did find it difficult to keep all of the cousins straight at times. But I will say that I will eventually continue with this series. Lissiannas brothers and Thomas intrigued me, and I have a feeling that the writing and storylines will improve. Maybe Ill even grow to like Lissianna and Greg as I get to know them more. I guess we will see!

I needn't have bothered as I doubt I will read the next one.  Below you will find a few spoilers about the universe although not the plot.

UNIVERSE SPOILERS:

  I began reading this book with optimism.  We start off with a kidnapping and a hungry vampire.  Not a bad place to start when reading a paranormal romance.  However, as the universe of this novel is described, I got disgusted, as the vampires are more cyborgs than vampires, perhaps they can be best described as vampiric cyborgs.  However, even if I could have gotten over that issue, I came against another one, this is a Pollyanna vampire story.  Everyone is NICE and helpful.  Centuries old beings behaving like teenagers in a 50s sitcom.

I admit.  I prefer my vampires to be traditional, but I can adapt and have enjoyed the True Blood Series (early books)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Until-Dark-A-True-Blood-Novel-1-Sookie-Stackhouse/dp/B0037471TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Until Dark: A True Blood Novel: 1 (Sookie Stackhouse)</a>, Black Dagger Brotherhood&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Lover-Number-1-in-series-Black-Dagger-Brotherhood-Series/dp/B004LX0DKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Lover: Number 1 in series (Black Dagger Brotherhood Series)</a>, I can even do the comedic in the Undead series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undead-and-Unwed-Undead-Queen-Betsy/dp/0425242269/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undead and Unwed (Undead/Queen Betsy)</a>&nbsp;.  However, this felt like one of those old black and white movies where one of the gang has a problem and everyone gathers together for a sing along and by the end everything is fixed and everyone is happy even the old curmudgeon.

Greg is an unsuspecting human who was kidnapped by Lissianna's mother.  Sounds intriguing? Trust me, it is.

Another stereotype that was debunked here was the myth that all vampire stories have to be dark and disturbed.  This book was filled with comical moments and a slow building romance.  It focused on family and friendships more than anything.  It was nice to watch the interactions among the all the characters, not just the leads.

Book #1 in the Argeneau Vampire series

Won't lie, I have had this book for well over 5 years now just sitting on my bookshelf. I kept telling myself that one day I would get all of the series and then read them all. Well that is not what happened. I picked it up and couldn't put it down. The cover of course is fitting and the title alone just screams one of the themes of this book. The characters where complex which i enjoyed as well as the supportive group of friends in which the lead character is surrounded by. There were parts of humor and ""uh oh"" all wrapped up in this one book. Definitely a wonderful start to the series. There are some adult moments but nothing that would make this dark in any way. I would recommend to anyone who likes adult vampire series. So 5 out of 5.",Great start to the series,1436400000,,

The book that started the now twenty-one book long series

I finally got around to reading A Quick Bite. I am hooked now on this series. This vampire paranormal romance was a good mix of danger, sexual attraction, and humor. I especially enjoyed how the characters got to know one another as people before getting into bed together or professing their love for one another.

In my opinion, A Quick Bite was better than the most recent book, The Immortal Who Loved Me. I cant say yet about all the other ones in between. I plan to read the next one in the series soon.

I don't have anything negative to say about this book. I have read some reviews that say the characters are not developed enough. I didn't think so. All of the characters, even the minor ones, felt like real people to me. Lynsay Sands does a great job with romance and character development.

The mythology wasn't anything unique, but that didn't bother me either. I think the humor makes up for that.

Lynsay Sands is now one of my favorite authors for paranormal romance, up there with Molly Harper and Vicki Lewis Thompson, who also know how to inject laughable moments into a love story. If you like vampire romance that can be silly at times, and you haven't read the Argeneau series yet, I definitely recommend checking it out.",Vampire romance that can be silly...,1431302400,,

This is about vampires wanting to do good in the world. They build corporations, they protect the humans from bad vampires and they don't believe in killing humans.

Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a Psychologist and he just finished his day of work. Walking through the parking lot, he gets kidnapped and knocked out by a woman. He wakes up and finds himself tied to a bed. A strange woman tells him that he's a birthday gift to her daughter, Lissianna, and he decides that she's crazy. But once he sees Lissianna, he can't get her out of his mind.

Lissianna is a beautiful vampire who hasn't found Mr. Right in centuries. But, once she lays her eyes on Dr. Gregory Hewitt, there's just something there that she can't deny.

I liked the storyline. There were some interesting ideas presented. Usually when there is a kidnapping, and life changing decisions to be made it's a woman (willingly) giving up her life to be with her love. In this case it was a man. It was a unique and refreshing take on that plot point.

As a whole though, it wasn't as deep as I was expecting it to be. I didn't feel connected to, or invested in, the characters. That made for a quick read. I don't feel like I NEED to read more from the series. It's nice to know they're available though.

So imagine my surprise when I noticed this book as 'Book 1'.  I wasted no time downloading it, as I usually enjoy these books.

And it wasn't as though I didn't enjoy this one--it was OK.  It just didn't compare with most of the ones that I've read.  As always, it was cute and entertaining.  The Romance was hot.  The Lifemate was found.  No cliffhanger ending.

However--the 200 year old Vampire Heroine was way too stupid and naive to have survived that long, sorry.

She faints at the sight of blood.  She doesn't figure out the obvious mortal suspect who suspects that she's a Vampire.  Even though she can read minds (she never read his).  Even though he tricked her into eating Garlic soup.  And he loaded up her office with Crucifixes.  And blesses the drinking fountain water so it becomes Holy Water.  I mean, Duh, right?

I could barely contain myself, and my eyes were sore because I was forever rolling then in exasperation.  Honestly, if this HAD been the first book of this series that I'd read, I'm not all that sure that I would have gone on to any further ones.  But rest assured, the others that I've read are better than this one.  And although it would be nice to read them in order (as many of the characters are regulars), it isn't really necessary to do so.","For Some Strange Reason,",1408924800,,
2.0,True,"07 30, 2014",A1R36VSDK6SNRR,B000GCFWXW,,Andrea Luhman,"I kept wishing the author had given her total work the attention to detail that she has given to her sex scenes. They were the only fluid scenes in the book. Those were well written. Otherwise the plot was predictable and boring. The only surprises I had reading this book was the number of times Greg found himself tied to a bed or chained up.
What I liked about the book:
1) Its a vampire story, so Im always curious to see the culture an author creates for such creatures. What the author creates is very sci-fi and unique.
2) Its a fantasy, vampire, romance novel. If you like a steamy romance scene, you can skip through the rest of the book and read just those parts. They are the only well thought out/ well written scenes in the book.
What I didn't like:
(Theres a lot I could digress and rant about, but I will focus on three main points.)
1) Redundancy. A good one third of the book is repetition. The reader has an event with a bit of action. Then the reader has to plow through a long narrative exposition about said event, being told every little detail about why such and such is bad or good. And then the same event is told again in a clumsy dialog between the characters.
2) Pointless characters. I like a book with a lot of characters, IF they are memorable and there is a point to them. There was no point to half the characters in this book. They were not memorable, they were not funny, and they did not add to the action or the drama. They were pointless. They went around dressing the same, talking the same, and behaving the same way.
3) Dialog. The majority of it was painfully awkward and provided little more than a parroting of information the reader already knows.",Campy and predictable,1406678400,,
4.0,True,"07 24, 2014",ARACFU5SUPKC2,B000GCFWXW,,Angie,"A Quick Bite was so fun! It's Lissianna's 202nd birthday and her mom has gotten her the ultimate present: a man. Greg was looking forward to his first vacation in years, but next thing he knows he's climbing into a stranger's trunk, then is tied to a bed. He's convinced that he's being gifted as a sex slave (which isn't so bad, really), while Lissi believes he's dinner. Actually, Lissi's mom chose Greg because he's a psychologist who specializes in phobias, and her daughter has a debilitating one. Lissi is hemaphobic, which is quite the problem when you're a vampire.

I loved the way vampires were presented and explained in A Quick Bite. They're human, but not quite superhuman, and definitely not dead or undead. Vampires are a kind of new strain of human which came about kind of by accident. A combination of nanotechnology and bioengineering created a way for damaged tissue and other ailments to be reversed. The nanos ended up being able to multiply using blood, essentially allowing humans to remain in peek condition for centuries or millennia. None of the vampire myths are true, except that they must consume blood to keep the nanos replenished. I adored this scientific take on vampires, but I had to wonder how this technology came about if the origin of vampires is in ancient times? Specifically at Atlantis...

Of course there's a romance between Greg and Lissi which I really enjoyed. There was a mutual attraction at first, but they did get to know each other while Greg was held hostage. Then some ""true mate"" stuff comes into play to speed things along, which is fine. But my favorite part was Lissi's family! Her birthday party is in full swing while Greg is tied up and he gets to meet everyone as the night went on, since they're all concerned about Lissi's phobia. It all made me smile and giggle, since it's clear how close the family is, and they've all got their quirks too. I'm definitely looking forward to getting to know them all better.

A Quick Bite was a great introduction to the Argeneau series! It's very light and doesn't take itself too seriously. Some bits are kind of cheesy, but in a fun and silly way rather than eye-roll inducing. I do wish more time had been focused on Lissi's phobia, but our couple manages to get themselves in quite the predicament when someone stumbles upon Lissi's secret identity as a vampire.

But let's talk about these two crazy kids for a second. Or, well, one two hundred year old vampire and the man she finds tied to her bed. Lissianna is charmingly sheltered for being two hundred years old. With her fear of blood and her father's legacy to contend with (not to mention growing up in a time when women were expected to be sheltered), this works.

Greg gets treated to the full crazy of falling into a family of vampires. Lissianna's family is insanely protective of her, which is a little funny seeing as he's tied up for the first part of this book. As he gets to know her and those around her, he sees how much she's respected and loved. Which, naturally, leads to THINGS HAPPENING. Because things happen when you've been abducted by vampires and find the woman you're destined to be with.

Although the ""mystery"" wasn't hard to figure out, there was a lot of fun set up for future books. I had a good time losing myself in these pages for a few hours. And that's what it's all about.

First Thought when Finished: A Quick Bite was a strong beginning to a ""new to me"" series!

Story Thoughts: A Quick Bite is one of those of books that might have read better for me if I wasn't constantly looking up when I was going to get stories for other characters in the story. I just never was completely invested in the love story of Lissi and Greg.* I was more invested in every one around them which means the story and I never clicked. That is on me as the reader, not on the author! Though I did like the lengths her mom would go to in order to help her little girl (no matter how old you are, you are always momma's little girl)!

Character Thoughts: I really enjoyed the characters introduced in A Quick Bite. In fact, I am pretty sure I fell head over heals for a few of them. Lissi was a cute character and I think really coming into her own.** I felt she still had some ""spreading her wings"" growing to do but with Greg in her corner that is going to happen. I love Greg! Poor guy handled everything like a champ even after thinking that he was the birthday present in a whole other way! He was a fun character and just down right adorable.

Final Thoughts: I enjoyed my trip into the Argeneeau's world and will most certainly be following up with the next book!***

*I like Lissi and Greg more now as a couple after reading a few more stories in the series.
**Lissi really has come into her own after a few books in the series. I guess this is the plus of me being ahead of my review writing.

I'm going to talk about the world building initially rather than the characters as I think the concept was pretty unique. Vampires actually originated from the technologically advanced, ancient Atlantis. They combined nanotechnology with bioengineering. These nanos which live inside their bodies require blood to keep the vampires in optimum condition. Vampires aren't allergic to the sun but it does mean the nanos have to work a bit harder to repair them and need more blood. It kept sparking memories of the epic science fiction show ""Red Dwarf"" which featured recalcitrant nanos.

Fearful of discovery, vampires no longer feed ""off the hoof"" but instead use blood banks to survive. Lissianna however is hemophobic which means she needs to either be fed blood intravenously or find victims she can feed off directly. Lissianna tries to combine her interest in social work with finding food and so works at a local shelter. She is affected by the blood she drinks so consuming the blood of a drunk or ill person affects her negatively. While the interactions between Lissianna and Greg were fun, they were not really deep and meaningful. I thought that Greg was far too calm and rational when he found out that vampires were real and got on the `vampires are cool' bandwagon way too fast. For a psychologist he is fairly shallow - when he's tied to a bed in a strange house with a bladder that is about to burst he thinks that it would be great to be a sex slave for someone like Lissianna. Come on. Despite this, I loved the fact that life mates were unable to read each other's minds or control each other. This offered the chance for a true partnership rather than having one dominate over the other.

The secondary characters, or should I say cast of thousands were really distracting. Even with the best will in the world, I couldn't differentiate between the HEA fodder. Introducing all of them at once seemed a bit of a clumsy move even though I can understand that some characters were needed to assure Greg that Lissianna was sweet and really needed his help. The interactions between the secondary characters lacked some maturity. A pyjama for people over the age of 200 just seemed bizarre and for no purpose other than to allow the females to strut around in their rainbow of baby-doll lingerie. The villain of the piece was no better constructed as he basically had a neon sign pointing to him, yet Lissianna and the others were completely flummoxed.

Try telling that to Lissiana Argenau, a relatively young vampire whose phobia really puts a damper on her quality of life (she is neither dead nor undead, thank you). It would be so conveniant to be able to keep the fridge stocked with a few bags of blood instead of having to feed the old-fashioned way without spilling even a drop!

When her mother hears about Dr. Gregory Hewitt, who specializes in treating phobias, she is delighted - what a perfect birthday present for Lissi! Maybe making an appointment would've been the reasonable approach, rather than tying the man to Lissiana's bed with a bow around his neck. That way, Lissi wouldn't have mistaken him for dinner. And Greg wouldn't have come to the conclusion that he was abducted to be her sex slave...

Pros:

A vampire with a blood phobia is a charming idea. The story starts out with tongue-in-cheek humour and a light-hearted take on supernatural romance, and manages to weave that through the whole novel, beginning to end... But. See further down under ""Cons""!

I like that the author tries a fresh aproach to scientifically explain the existance of vampires - I just don't like the execution, which I will also talk about a bit further down. I do like that these vampires are still very much in touch with their human side, and that they live in families - there are no dark, brooding, tortued creatures of the night here, which is a nice change.

Lissi is a nice character, and so is Greg... In fact, all of the main characters are likable. Heck, I even sort of liked the ""villain"" (at least until he really lost it towards the end.)

Cons:

The language is a bit repetitive at times, and often, the author over-explains and over-describes. There were a few scenes that got a chuckle out of me, but in many situations, the humor felt forced and construed.

Some of the characters lack depth. Maybe they will be developed more in the other books of the series, though?

The scientific explanation seems more than a little far-fetched to me. I don't want to give too much away, but there are a few details that just don't make much sense. (If you need more blood in your *veins*, then *drinking* blood isn't going to do you much good?) While I usually like it when an author doesn't simply say ""It's magic!"" and calls it a day, I'd prefer that to an explanation that I can't ""believe"" in.

For people who are supposed to be very intelligent, both Lissi and Greg are downright oblivious to what goes on around them and/or fail to draw the right conclusions to what they witness. I don't want to spoiler you too much, so here's just a small example:

Greg is abducted by people who can obviously control his mind. When Lissi finds him tied to her bed, she thinks he's dinner. Her young cousins talk about drinking bagged blood in front of him. Lissi's mother looks as young as her daughter. Nobody seems to make much effort to hide what they are. And it doesn't occur to him at all that they might be vampires (or at least suffer from the delusion that they are) until he sees the bite marks on his neck?

The love story between Greg and Lissi is cute but a bit lackluster. From the first time they meet, it's clear that they are going to turn out to be soulmates eventually, but I didn't really feel the the spark. It had all the suspense of a cooking recipe: take one pretty vampire, add a hunky doctor, sprinkle some spicy misunderstandings on top and stir until you get a perfect couple.

It feels like there isn't enough plot there to fill a novel, so the author tacks on two threatening issues: a mysterious person who's out to harm Lissi, and an authoritarian vampire uncle who might have Greg's mind wiped. It's a classic pattern: person A and person B fall in love, but there is conflict C that stands between them and possible villain D that means them harm, so they need to come up with solution E to gain their happy end.

But it shouldn't be so bloody obvious! (Pun intended.) Don't get me started on the ""mysterious"" person! From the first time he is introduced, it is absolutely 100% crystal clear what's going to happen - and it's absolutely 100% unbelievable that Lissi doesn't even have a clue! Come on, she CAN'T be that dense? I literally groaned out loud when I realized that the book really *was* going to end the way I'd suspected all along; I'd hope that it was a red herring.

Summary:

I honestly wanted to like this novel because it seemed right up my ally: vampires, a love story, quirky humour and an unusual explanation. But the logical flaws and the utterly ridiculous obtuseness of the main characters sort of killed it for me.

I'm still going to pick up the next novel, because I feel that the author has something here that *could* be really fun and entertaining, and I'm hoping that this novel just suffered from first-book-syndrome.",Have some garlic soup and look at my cross collection!,1370131200,,

*Beware of Spoilers*

Dr. Greg Hewitt is wrapping things up at work at his psychology practice on the last night before his first real vacation in years!  As he is thinking of sand and sun and the things he will enjoy during his trip to Cancun, he notices a woman getting on the elevator with him as he's leaving the office.  He was surprised when she gets off at the same garage level as he does, but wasn't that concerned about it.  But he can't understand what has come over him when he puts himself in the trunk of the woman's car, goes home with her, and then obediently goes upstairs lies on the bed and allows her to tie him to the bed.

The woman is Marguerite Ageneau, a vampire, who has decided to give Greg to her daughter, Lissianna, as a birthday gift.  Lissianna is a vampire that faints at the sight of blood and Greg specializes in curing phobias and Marguerite wants him to cure Lissianna so she can live a normal life and feed from bags of blood like most vampires instead of taking chances by feeding off live donors, which sometimes leads her to getting drunk or worse when she doesn't notice the condition of her dinner until it's too late.

Lissianna feels bad that Greg is being held against his will because of her.  So she and her cousins sneak Greg out of the house and take him home, but they forgot to erase his memories.  So Lissianna's mom and aunt go to take care of it, but are unable to wipe his memories and worse, he has figured out what they are.  So they take him back home with them and contact the council to determine what must be done.

Lissianna takes Greg on the run when she finds out that nobody can erase Greg's memories and she worries what that will mean for him.

This series came highly recommended to me, but after reading this saying I was underwhelmed is an understatement.  I think my big problem with the book is that it seems too unrealistic.  A guy gets kidnapped twice and he's cool with it.  He doesn't even mind missing out on his vacation that he's been planning for months, but instead spends a couple of days tied to a bed by a bunch of vampires.  The whole thing just doesn't play for me, no matter how hot Lissianna is.  And the romance in this book just didn't work for me; it felt too rushed and even at the end of the book they still felt like strangers instead of lovers let alone life mates.  Not to mention her phobia never gets cured.

I also found the vampires' fangs were really strange in this book.  I'm used to them being used to puncture the humans' veins for them to feed, but in this book they seem more like straws.  When they drink bagged blood they put it on their teeth and suck it down.  I thought it was pretty weird myself.

I saw the supposed plot twist about Father Joseph a mile away and figured he suspected Lissiana of being a vampire from the moment he offered her the garlic soup and didn't really feel the office full of crosses was necessary to drive the point home.  If Sands wanted this twist to be a surprise, she should have been more subtle.

This book was marketed as being funny, but I just didn't see it.  I think I laughed once.

""Still in Bed?"" Thomas had asked with amusement, as Lissianna had blinked at them. ""I am so glad you got at least a little rest today. I feared you'd work Greg to death while the rest of us tried to sleep.""

The book did start getting better toward the end, but it just wasn't enough for me to truly like it.  Maybe the next book in the series will be better.  One hopes so anyway.

I don't know how it came to be in my possession, but it became my favorite bathroom book. Yes, I read it while...well, you know. And it was entertaining.
Knowing it was the fourth book in a series, I had always meant to read the others, but I just never got around to it. ""Readers woes."" And then A Quick Bite, the first in the Argeneau Vampire series magically went on sale at B&N for $0.99. Romance and vampires....how's a girl supposed to resist?
It could be that I have developed more discerning tastes in the last few years...but I didn't find myself enjoying A Quick Bite as much as I did Tall, Dark & Hungry. The writing was fun, engaging and the characters all witty, so it's not that I didn't identify with them (okay, okay, ""identify"" is strong language for a vampire book, but you get what I'm saying!). I think it's just that I sometimes found the story SO ridiculous, that even as a fictional vampire book, it was too much for me to believe. Call it what you will.
Some of my problems with the story lay with Greg, the kidnappee, becoming totally a-okay with being kidnapped. Hey, I don't care what the reasoning was, it just felt un-fricken-believable. Stockholm Syndrome much??? I also had a problem with the entire coven of vampires openly talking about their vampirism in front of Greg when he didn't even know about it...and then acting all shocked when he heard them. ""OMG, WE WERE TALKING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU HEARD US... NO WAY!""  For vampires, some of them were just really fricken stupid. Come on, man.
But I think the thing that aggravated me the most was that I knew who the bad guy was, before there was even a bad guy. I hate when authors lead me around by the nose, like I won't be able to figure it out for myself...or even worse, like I don't like surprises. It also felt like the said bad guy was there as an after thought, just to move the story from point A to point B, with no true substance. Because sometimes he was there, and then he would be forgotten for large portions of the book.  Snooze.  I don't know, maybe there was some deeper meaning there and I just blindly missed it.
But you know what? Overall, I did enjoy reading the book. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it a lot. I sort of wish I hadn't even spent 99 cents on it, but it is what it is. There is definite sexual chemistry for all you smut lovers out there, but there isn't a ton of sex...this isn't Black Dagger Brotherhood, after all. But it's probably still up your alley. I did like the twist Sands puts on how the vampires came into existance in the first place.  Either it's been so long since I read the other book that I had forgotten, or it isn't mentioned in that one at all.  Either way, it was news to me, and pretty fascinating to boot.  I like when an author mixes a bit of cultural legend with fiction.  The writing was funny and engaging as well, and yes, it was meant to be a comedy, because it did get quite a few lulz out of me.

Generally speaking it's a fun book to read if you're a fan of the vampire/supernatural genre. There are a few technical problems here and there but as long as you try not to take those things too seriously and you'll be fine.

For example, there are places where there exists large, multi-paragraph descriptions, devoted to the observation of a single thing. All the while, the characters do nothing but stare blankly at said thing.  To those of you who have watched the TV show ""The Wonder Years"", you know what I'm talking about. There were occasions when characters stared blankly at objects and said nothing. They just kept thinking their inner monologue. Personally, there were times I imagined how weird that looked, to stand in a room where two main characters just stare at each other for an extended length of time, and have nothing happen. Just looking... and looking... and looking... But, that's just me. You can skim those paragraphs if they get too long, and you'll still be ok.

This story works fine as a stand alone book. As someone who hasn't read any other books from the series, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything story wise. In some series' you would sometimes encounter unexplained characters, who would only make sense if you had read the other books. In this book though, I never felt like there were any obligatory cameos at all. The book's female protagonist did have a large family (The Argeneau Family), the members of which, I asume, are each the subject of their own books in the line. They all had different personalities, but since they had the same goal, in the end, memorizing every name and motivation wasn't an issue, so I never felt lost or confused.

There's a vampire hunter sub-plot. It was ok. It did what it had to, and didn't get in the way of the romance, the latter, of course, being the important bit.

There was one rather large large plot that never gets resolved at the end, which kind of bothered me. The author did that thing where the book simply goes: It will get resolved in the future, even though you don't read about it here, or anywhere else, it will get resolved, trust me. The end.

That being said, as long as you read this book as the tale of a kind hearted vampire with issues and a psychiatrist who finds himself falling for her, you'll be fine. Let the details worry about themselves...

Lissianna is a vampire who cannot stand the sight of blood - she faints.  Not a good thing for a vampire.  She is a social worker at a shelter in Toronto.  On her 202 birthday she is out with her cousins and attempts to get a quick bite from a guy who has been hitting on her.  He is anemic and a bit of a big so she leaves him behind a dumpster after clearing his memory.  The group then heads to her mothers house for a birthday party.  When Lissi goes to her old room for a change of stockings she finds a man tied to her bed.  Her cousins had mentioned that her mother had a special present for her.  Thinking he is her tasty treat she takes a bite.  Wrong move - he's there to cure her of her phobia.  What all happens next is funny, sad, exciting and fast paced.

The Blurb does say it all.

My thoughts:

This one was on the lighter side of paranormal romance. Sure there was some passion and danger, but there was also this light vibe and some humour.

I liked the plot idea. Lissianna is an 200 year old vampire, she has no problem biting down on a neck but in these modern times most blood comes in bad. And Lissi has one big problem, she faints at teh sight of blood. Her mother kidnaps a hunky men and leaves him on her bed, the doctor to fix her problems. A sexy doctor that makes her long for a bit more.

Lissi was nice, and after delving deeper into her past I understand her fear of blood. Greg was understanding, well, after a while, and they seemed to good for each other. But being immortal is not that easy when it comes to men.

And there I come into the best part of the book, the vampires. Not silly cross fearing, no shadows bloodsuckers here. No there is a good scientific reason; Atlantis, scientist, nanobots into bloodstreams to cure illness, and those same nanos were just too good. Which left the people almost immortal, but in a need of blood not to die. The same nanos can be transferred from mother to child, and if you find you perfect mate. There you got, vampires created by mistake by a superior people. I loved the originality of this.

The tone is light, and had me reading fast. One thing did bother me, a certain danger that emerged and that was so obvious but that Lissi did not see. But then she did have Mr Hunk on her mind so I forgive her.

My recommendation and final thoughts:

I liked this book, and it is a series that I would recommend. There are still lots of single vamps that need to find true love, and I wonder what dangers might emerge. A 3,5 with a promise of more to come. I enjoyed this story, and I sure enjoyed the background for the story.

3.0,True,"12 21, 2008",A2CCQ83OH7WGAE,B000GCFWXW,,Chelsea Marie Spencer,"This paranormal romance is presented as a comedy, a much lighter take on 'the vampire genre' then many you will find. This alone makes it stand out from the crowd, but despite the unique angle, it is not extraordinary.

The Plot:

Lissianna is a vampire who happens to be afflicted with hemophobia (she faints at the sight of blood). Greg is a psychologist who specializes in phobias. Lissianna's mother kidnaps Greg and presents him to Lissianna as a birthday present in hopes that he will cure her phobia. She, however, mistakes him for a snack--and also finds herself desperately attracted to him. The feeling is evidently mutual, thus romance ensues.

The Best Thing About This Book:

There really are some laugh-out-loud moments, especially in the beginning. It's situational comedy at its best.

There are also some rather sweet moments between Greg and Lissianna. Sands does a fair job at establishing their feelings for one another, even in the midst of all the silliness.

Why it Lost Two Stars:

Despite the fact that this book is entertaining at times, overall it falls into the category of average. The world that Sands presents is not very unique when compared to anything else in the paranormal or fantasy genres. As such, experienced readers may find it predictable and boring.

The characters are too many, and not all that well developed. We are presented with an entire cast of cousins, far to many to keep track of, and we really aren't told much about them to make them memorable. Even the main characters are undeveloped and somewhat unbelievable. I had particular trouble with Greg. I simply could not understand what motivated him throughout the story to stay with Lissianna, what kept him from being angry with her family, or why in the end he fell in love with her (the emotion is made plain, but not the rationale).

There were moments in the plot, even those more serious moments, when I simply felt that the book was way to silly. The antics of the book's villain, a priest with a drive to kill vampires, were ridiculous and not particularly funny.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, fun read. I advise that it is not meant to be taken seriously, and will likely not appeal to many of the more jaded paranormal romance readers.",Good for a Laugh,1229817600,,

They're all good reads, lots of fun (if a tiny bit predictable after the third or fourth one), and I'd call them delightful brain candy.  But one would think that an author characterized as a ""New York Times bestseller"" would rate a bit better editor and proofreader than these books rated.  In other words, there are errors that detract from the reading experience as far as I'm concerned.  Granted, I'm a bit of a ""grammar nazi,"" and I freely admit this.  But come on; with the price of books these days, do we as purchasers and readers not deserve better than to read offerings that include errors such as the use of ""past"" when the context indicates that ""passed"" is correct? (No, the two words are not interchangeable.)  Equally, the author's use of ""he and Joe"" in place of the correct ""him and Joe"" is disturbing.  Equally disconcerting are the number of comma errors throughout each of the books, print or electronic.  So read the books, enjoy the stories, but don't depend on them for improving your grammar.

I found the vamp's family all to be intriguing and fairly fleshed out and I can see reading more books about them.  There are definately some aspects of the relationship that don't ring true, for example how quickly they fall in love.  Obviously, also, in real circumstances, if you were mind tricked, tied to a bed, and made 'dessert' for a vampire, you'd probably be freaked out and running away from, and not straight to, the vampire.

So how can I get interested in these vampires when the next book has a married brother unmarried and half the characters missing who were in the last story and someone is married who never had a story.  What sense does that make?  A primary reason for getting attached to a series is that the characters continue to grow not regress.  I can hardly make sense out of who is supposed to be mated and who is not.  What publisher would do such a thing and for what reason. Certainly not to get readers hooked.  Believe me it took me a while to realize what was wrong with the series and why it seemed so confusing to me.  If I were an author I would never let my work be published in that way.  Was Ms. Sands afraid to argue with her publisher for fear of being dumped. She should have held out for the correct order and thus make this series ten times more enjoyable and 100 time more addictive. I was so disgusted when I realized who the main characters were (they were already married in a previous book).

New Publisher, the vamps are no longer with Dorchester.  They're now put out by Avon (though Dorchester will continue to do her Historicals).  Originally, this was the very first Argeneau tale in the series, not Single White Vampire (Lucern's tale).  So it's great to finally get Lucern's little sister's story.  As followers of the series know, the Argeneau vamps are the modern day, intelligent sort, who know feasting in the wild can get ""blood"" with all sorts of problems.  In order to skip all this rather mundane ugliness, they've invested in blood banks that see them supplied with a full range of ""flavors"" and blood that is safe!  Only, Lissianna really has trouble with this popping her fangs into a blood bag and having a quick munchie.

So Mama Argeneau sets out to give Lissianna the perfect present - one sexy male tied up and waiting.  Well, Lissianna wants Mr. Right, not just Mr. Available.  She's tired of her vamp immortal life, and would like someone to share it with.  Lissianna has other problems, such as her fainting at the sight of blood, an annoying trait for a vampire.  For a Birthday gift, Mama has gone out and fetched Dr. Gregory Hewitt, used mind control to get him to tuck himself up in the trunk of her car, and now has him tied up nekkid on Lissianna's bed.  Wouldst that all mums were so obliging on birthdays!

Greg was planning a much-needed vacation.  The last he recalls is leaving the office and planning on getting away.  Instead, he wakes up in a stranger's bedroom.  Well, he's male - this cannot be all bad.  Okay, she's a vampire romance may be a bit difficult to work out, but to quote Joey Brown in Some Like it Home, ""nobody's perfect.""

At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.

The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.

There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.

My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.

The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.",I love the NYT -- sometimes.

Second, NYT is a great paper.  I haven't gotten newspapers in a while, due wanting to cut down on the amount of trash I generate, and because I got tired of excessive advertising.  Blah, blah, blah .... now that I'm getting NYT as a wake up each morning, I'm remembering what I was missing.

I'm spending 20 minutes per morning reading through the parts I find interesting.  It's good stuff.  I'll probably continue after the trial is over.

That said, I agree that that price is a tad high.  I'd be much more comfortable with less than $20 per month, considering how much is stripped out.

Also... someone at NYT should read these before they go out.  The Bridge column last week made numerous references to the missing diagram.  I can understand leaving out some pictures, but vital pictures should never be left out.  If you're going to leave out pictures, I think all the static Op-ed pictures can be left out.  The bridge column without diagrams is pointless, so it should be added to items to strip out -- or to include diagrams with.

Good science section so far.  I miss the crossword.  Even if the crossword wasn't interactive, I'd love to see it.  I have some grid paper.

NYT is really close here, I think, so with a little more care, they could have something less frustrating to send out.

I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.

Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

The paper has gone downhill: the writing has suffered, analysis is almost gone, and the paper has become more and more biased.  While the navigation is good, the Kindle version frequently has typos, and it will refer you to the website Post for many interesting articles which are clipped short.  As I am a local, I expect the Post to also cover local news, but it is deficient in what it selects.  There are some major issues going on, but they prefer to go back to some crime that is unsolved and happened years ago rather than dig into current issues--it's probably cheaper.  The Post covers politics, but the reporting is typically he said, she said with little or no research or analysis, and the editorial and news selection slant is decidedly pro-illegal immigrant.  I am not a conservative, but I would like more balanced reporting regardless of what the editorial board has to say.  To be fair, the Post occasionally has a fact checker article that is useful.

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!

The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.

During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!

While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.

4.0,True,"05 26, 2012",A1ZPIYFT6VHWIF,B000JMKNQ0,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},David Pruette,"Boba Fett: A Practical Man by Karen Traviss is a short story that gives the reader an excellent idea of the mindset of the famed bounty hunter. Fett is, of course, a familiar figure to all Star Wars fans, and it is interesting to read a story that concentrates primarily on him. Plus, Karen Traviss had been an excellent writer for Star Wars for quite some time until the two parties went their separate ways.

The plot of the story is based on a seemingly normal contract for a job that Boba Fett accepts with a mysterious client. Fett and his team are hired to start a small war. However, the war turns out to be the beginning of an invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong. Boba quickly realizes that they are supporting the wrong side, that success by the alien Yuuzhan Vong will probably mean the end of the Mandalorian culture and lots of other cultures.

So, the practical man is in a quandary. Does he honor the contract he agreed to or does he do what he can to subvert the efforts of the aliens? One further problem is that he may have to work with a Jedi agent if he decides to resist the invaders. The Yuuzhan Vong are an incredibly dangerous foe and make for some extremely entertaining reading.

Ms Traviss has always seemed to be fascinated with Mandalorians. Her books are riddled with their language, and she has delved into their culture at great length. On the other hand, she has not seemed to be a big fan of the Jedi. This story gives her an opportunity to branch out and basically just focus on Boba Fett.

This story was published as an e-book and may be readers' introduction to the Yuuzhon Vong or people may run across the aliens for the first time in Vector Prime. Either way works fine to give the reader exposure to some serious bad guys.

Boba Fett: A Practical Man is an excellent story in the New Jedi Order and is well worth reading.",Boba Fett at work,1337990400,3,
4.0,False,"03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,B000JMKNQ0,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Andrew Pruette,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.

So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.

This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.

Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order,1331769600,6,

Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.

Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly.

4.0,False,"05 21, 2006",A1J6B00Z1D6PS4,B000JMKQKS,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},Jimmy Moore from Livin&#039; La Vida Low-Carb,"Now that the media has jumped off the low-carb bandwagon and has resorted to bashing it to no end, they are desperately looking for another diet plan to embrace. What's interesting is that most of these ""new"" diet plans are nothing more than just an advanced look at the low-carb lifestyle.

From the glycemic index to the glycemic load of foods, it can all be very confusing. That's where Dr. Rob Thompson's ""The Glycemic Load Diet"" book comes into play.

Dr. Thompson, a board-certified cardiologist for nearly three decades and author of ""The New Low Carb Way Of Life"", believes that too many of the diet books focus heavily on the glycemic index while all but ignoring the glycemic load.

The glycemic load does more than look at what is in the foods you eat, but also in the serving size that it comes in. As Dr. Thompson puts it, ""Low carb dieting suddenly becomes a pleasure"" when you take into account the glycemic load.

""The Glycemic Load Diet"" does something very important for any effective and permanent weight loss plan -- the book encourages exercise at least every other day that will not harm your body and will keep your insulin levels stablized and ultimately get you slim and trim. Too many other diet plans out there brag about not needing any exercise, but that is a sure-fire way to sabotage your weight loss plan.

The crux of ""The Glycemic Load Diet"" is around hormonal imbalance and how it causes people to crave foods they just don't need to eat. Dr. Thompson identifies what those ""toxic"" foods are that cause the cravings (HINT: sugar, white flour, starchy and processed foods -- sound familiar anyone?) and shows you how to eliminate those foods forever so the cravings go away.

""The Glycemic Load Diet"" is divided into three distinct parts focusing on various aspects of your plan for success: Understanding Insulin Resistance, The Glycemic Load Diet And The Slow-Twitch Muscle Activation Plan (very interesting concept!), and Proven Strategies To Balance Your Metabolism And Stay On Track.

While what you read about in ""The Glycemic Load Diet"" is certainly friendly to people who are livin' la vida low-carb, Dr. Thompson believes the science behind insulin resistance has moved beyond what Dr. Robert C. Atkins has previously written about. That's why he believes people should pay attention to the glycemic load.

Dr. Thompson contends that people who reduce their glycemic load will not only lose weight, but will also lose their desire for starchy and sugary carbohydrates which cause spikes in your blood glucose and ultimately weight gain. However, he contends that ""sugar can be your ally"" in weight loss because it can stimulate your tastebuds. I don't think so! Sugar is very addictive and can lead some people who cannot control their urge to eat more and more of it to go overboard. With all due respect to Dr. Thompson, that part of his diet is not very wise.

Finally, ""The Glycemic Load Diet"" discusses fat, cholesterol, and other factors in keeping your metabolism in check for permanent weight control. Of course, Dr. Thompson shares a few of his favorite recipes to get you off on the right foot to begin this new way of eating. There's even a glycemic load food chart in the back of the book so you can follow your progress in your lifestyle change.

In the end, Dr. Thompson says it may not be your fault if you are overweight because of your family history of insulin resistance. But he did say ""The Glycemic Load Diet"" is ""something you CAN do"" to change that now.

If you've tried every other low-carb diet plan and none of them made sense, then perhaps the glycemic load concept will be just what you need to lose weight and get healthy. I'm sure Dr. Thompson would agree with me that there is hope for you as long as you apply sound scientific research to your life.

2.0,True,"10 6, 2016",A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000JMKQKS,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},Lizardhaven,"When I found how much I gained form the Jason Fung information I decided that I should do some studying on other diet related theories that I had no knowledge of.  And as usual I went by the customer feedback on the amazon pages to quickly find the most valuable books to read on things like the paleo diet and the glycemic index stuff.
When I put in the search terms 'glyceimc index'  for Amazon books I was a bit dismayed to have a page come up with a dozen or so paperbacks that had names and covers appearing to all be in a series done identically. When I clicked on titles, and went right to the customer reviews, it seemed that all the customers had the same feeling about the books, as if they were nearly identical.  A few people thought what they got was all they would ever need to know, and these must have been people who did not have much information about the subject.
Others like me, who left reviews, had information on the subject and wanted something more in depth. These comments were that the lists with glycemic loads of various food were all about packaged foods that they had stopped eating long ago, as I had, and not whole foods. I also noticed that the lists of foods all seemed to be identical from some government source.
Comments by people who felt a book lacked certain things led me along to other titles they said were better. So in time I did get to a book that had a bit more than the other did, 'Glycemic Load Diet' by Robb Thompson.
Any book would give the basics, and the number of pages was also almost identical.  And the cover comments of how wonderful the book was, seemed to all be by authors of almost identical books. And each book seemed to have the last third be recipes.  Excuse me, but I have spices and ingredients thee authors never even heard of and cook healthy and very tasty meals  people are crazy for and I don't need a list of a dozen ingredients to measure and out in separate containers to mix in a special sequence. I grab stuff from where and there and put it all in one bowl, and if they had given me more glycemic numbers for real food it would have been a bit nicer for the diet thing, but otherwise still great.
And I have news for all these authors ALMOST NO ONE BUT ME AND A FEW OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWERS ACTUALLY COOKS WITH REAL FOOD ANYMORE.  Do they really think the fast food junkies in enough dietary trouble to buy their books is going to get all that stuff and measure it and make those time consuming dishes?  I don't think so.
And some of the numbers I question because, for example I gave up 99% of wheat in my diet years ago. And years ago I found that pastas made from things that were not grains, were not exactly like wheat pastas, but were pretty good. And I also noticed that they did not make my blood sugar reading so drastic as anything wheat would do. I realized that the pasta from beans and roots and  pumpkin were what the glycemic index was all about. Only the lists showed they had the name number as wheat pasta. So it sort of missed what we were hoping to learn from the lists.
I did get a number of important points out if the book. Fotr example, all the years of carb counting I read books that hinted alcohol did not have carbs as such, but anyone with sense would avoid it if all possible.  I believed that authors were just raining on the parade instead of saying 'GOOD NEWS, GET AS DRUNK AS YOU LIKE ON THIS DIET!!' the glycemic index I assume is the same in every book showed the same  < 'less than' sign it did for the meat and other protein foods as having no carbs to speak of . the text dais that alchhol could make you want to eat more, but that was all.  So let me give you the good news, you can get as drunk as you like on the diet!!  Now I don't drink often so when I do a very small amount works real good.  And given some very disturbing things happening at the time (what the I Ching calls 'misfortune from without', not something I caused to happen) and I was finding one a day of those little bud-a rama fake 8% margueritas for over a week  and binge watching historical costume Korean soap operas was making my life a lot less stressful.
I did get a few things out of this book, but it does not rise far above the rest of the assembly line to serve a new audience. If there is an author out there who has some real in depth information and insight on glycemic index stuff, I, and at least several dozen others reviewing similar books did not find that person.
While the glycemic diet is just another Atkin's  spin off, there are some things we did not know before that  that make it a bit easier to stay on, such as eating a bit of sweet at the end of the meal.  This I had already found helped to get my blood sugar to go down more after a meal.  I wish there had been more detail about that.  And since I did skip some parts perhaps there is.
Right now I am an annoyed person and it is not easy to clear my mind to read books and put other thoughts aside. But then I think most people who are looking for a book of this kind are the same way.  And those of us who had to go total zero carbs for a couple weeks on Atkin's to get purple in the dig stick, may not do so well with the sweet at the end thing.
Back wen we read Atkin's, we got some real info and most of us lost a lot of weight that stayed off for pretty long.  It remains to be seen whether there is any startling results to be happy about from dealing with the glycemic index.",not as much helpful information as i had hoped for,1475712000,8,

To overcome hypoglycemia, you first have to learn whether you have underlying problems that Prof. Steven Rochlitz is uniquely renowned for uncovering at last.

Porphyria is the major hidden problem causing hypoglycemia, Dr. Rochlitz reveals. Porphyria is NOT a rare disease. This metabolic disorder may affect 20% of us. Dr Rochlitzs first book on porphyria even includes blood sugar test guidelines for porphyria and reactive hypoglycemia.  The book also notes that blood sugar IV parameters for porphyria are similar to standard treatment for hypoglycemics.

I can tell you for myself that hypoglycemia can result from porphyria and that dealing with the porphyria can finally yield stable blood sugars.

The book that saved my life and that finally led to my no longer having blood sugar crashes, is  PORPHYRIA: The Ultimate Cause of Common, Chronic, & Environmental Illnesses, With Breakthroughs in Diet, Supplements, and Energy Balancing, by Steven  Rochlitz, PhD.

The porphyria connection is also crucial because the hidden porphyric reacts to many drugs, and even to many supplements. Often people say,  those supplements didn't work for me either.

Dr. Rochlitzs books are not sold on Amazon. You can find them at his wellatlast dot com site. I would immediately check out the testimonials page there for reviews by laypeople and physicians, and even a Supreme Court Justice.

Also on that testimonials page is a link to a great, free, recent interview on how porphyria is not rare and is a cause of hypoglycemia. Youll love the interview, and the book.

For the record, I have no financial connection to Dr. Steven Rochlitz, but following his books recommendations ended my blood sugar crashes at last.",It's Missing the Most Crucial Factor Causing Hypoglycemia in Many,1436918400,3,

South Beach does not cut it for me for a lot of reasons. The text is straight-forward without too much overwhelming science. Some books take up more than half the book with needless detail science, when some down-to-earth explanations will do.
I liked this book for the following reasons:
1) has information about exercise and diabetes that I have not seen anywhere else before. Was very useful to me in planning my workouts.
2) has excellent suggestions for breakfast including a good explanation of the differences in cereals.
3) ""allows"" fruits but at a somewhat limited level
I did not like it for the following reasons (and therefore gave it a 4)
1) it is incomplete in food listings. I had to buy another index and a GI index to get better information on certain foods.
2) recipes are limited and not all that interesting (but don't buy a book - you can figure it out)

And one more comment - I can not find a good on-line tracker that includes the GL load easily. I found one site but it was too complicated. So I am back to checking lists, though by this time, I've got most of the values figured out.","Easy to follow, makes sense",1342569600,2,
3.0,False,"04 3, 2012",ADVLRJS633OTD,B000JMKQKS,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},Susanna Hutcheson,"This is a well written book and interesting. But the author glosses over a few things and totally eliminates others. For one, he raves on about how good statin drugs are. Now, of course, we know they may indeed have a link to diabetes. That likely was not known when he wrote the book.

Moreover, he says that Dr. Atkins died of an accident. He has not reason to say why he died other than to defend him against his own diet. I'm not sure we know why Dr. Atkins died but the author wants us to believe it was an accident.

On the surface, this sounds like a good eating program. But there's not enough science to back it up. I personally tend to agree with most of it. But, there are flaws in light of recent studies.

I certainly think that we know (at least at this time in our evolution) that sugar/carbs are not good when consumed to excess. In ten years that theory may change like everything else in medicine and fitness does. But as diets go, this one is good and I think would work. But, I still think that a person would have to restrict his calorie intake if he wants to lose weight.

He also expresses his belief in ""aerobics"" and we now know that aerobics are not all that great. If done at all, they should be done in spurts and in minutes, not hours.

I was having problems sleeping one evening and happened to just grab this particular book from her to be read file figuring.  Why not?  (As if I do not have my own massive to be read mound of books stashed here and there all over the house...Duh to me).

I must admit that I was upset at first due to the fact that I was absolutely clueless as to the plot line, characters and constant references to past events.  The next morning my wife informed me that this was one book in a series and that to really make sense of it I really needed to go back to the beginning, i.e. previous books in this series.

That is okay though, once I found this information I was able to kick in my imagination, overlook some holes in the plot and finished the novel in good shape.

Basically this is a series about a group of women  The Sisterhood  who seek out revenge against those justly deserving punishment but who for some reason are untouchable by our legal system.  Yes folks, this is a vigilante revenge book as are the other in this series.  While most of the book is pretty mellow dealing with the love life of various members of The Sisterhood (or so it would seem) I must tell you that there is some EXTREME violence involved with these stories.  This group of women simply does not mess around in dealing out justice, no, no, no!  Good grief!

If you are the sort of person against, or are uncomfortable with good revenge stories, then you probably want to avoid this one.  If you are uncomfortable with graphic violence (I am talking torture her folks), you might want to avoid this one.

This sort of thing does not particularly bother me as long as animals are not involved and as a matter of fact I dearly love a good tale of revenge...I read The Count of Monte Cristo when I was very, very young and it is still a favorite of mine.

This particularly well written tale have our revenge seeking group going after and extreme wife beater and a husband and wife team who abuse horse.

The story is well written and I was able to enjoy it even though there were gapping holes in the story line and characters which I had to sort of read around.  This was not the authors fault...no it was mine.

I think now I will go back and play catch-up and read the novels which came before this one.
