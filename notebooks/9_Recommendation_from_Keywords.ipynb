    "The main problem of the recommendation systems is cold-start problem. Specifically, it concerns the issue that the system cannot draw any inferences for users or items about which it has not yet gathered sufficient information. For my case, it creates problem when the user or book is new for system. To handle this, I decided to try another approach. I will make recommendations with a few information about user. I will find suitable books from keywords of user such that 'I love to love story' or 'best ever book' etc. To do this, I will find the text similarities of keywords and reviews. It is very common from summaries, genres or names of books to do this, but for a different approach I assumed that I will no information about summaries or genres about books or as general, we can assume that we only have reviews about products from previous customers and we want to offer new customer according to his/her keywords. \n",

    "It is hard to say that the book which has average rating as 5 with only 8 comment is better than the book rated as 4 with 2000 reviews. More reviews on product means more reliability. So, I will add multiplier to my rating function which give less effect if the rating is less than threshold. I will determine a threshold rating value for this. If the number of rating is not above this threshold, it will not effect my function too much.\n",
